    Analyze the following text and insert <BOS> (Begin of Scene) tags only where a new semantic scene begins.
    If the text starts with an incomplete scene from a previous section, continue that scene and only add <BOS> tags for new scenes after it.

    Guidelines:
    - Scene shifts: A new scene usually starts when there is a major change in time or location, or a change of narrative or thematic focus during the same situation.
    - Dialogue continuity: Do not add a <BOS> tag if the scene remains the same during an ongoing conversation, unless there is a change in the focus of the discourse.
    - Minor transitions: Small movements within the same setting should not trigger a new scene tag unless the overall narrative shifts significantly.
    - Sentence integrity: Only place <BOS> tags at the beginning of sentences that introduce a new scene. Do not break sentences unnecessarily.
    - Event and Action focus: Only one major event or action usually happens per scene.
    - Thematic shifts: Continuous narration can consist of multiple scenes if the thematic focus substantially changes.
    - Time and Place words: Introductory words indicating time or place changes are potential indicators of a new scene. For example: "The next day", "Later", "In the forest", "On the way to...", "One day", "One evening", etc. might indicate a new scene.
    - Difference between anticipation and resolution: The anticipation of an event can be in one scene, and the resolution in another.

    Text to analyze:
    {window_text}

    Please return the text with <BOS> tags inserted only where significant narrative shifts occur. If the text starts with a continuation of a previous scene, do not add a <BOS> tag at the beginning.
