        Here are the entities extracted by a named entity recognition system:
        {entities}

        For each entity, provide:
        1. The standardized entity name (lowercase with underscores)
        2. The best appellation (most complete/formal version of the name)
        3. All possible appellations (variations of the name)
        4. The biological sex of the character ('M' for male, 'F' for female, or null for unknown/non-person entities)

        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        - Be careful with names that share the same surname (like "Derek Shepherd" and "Addison Shepherd"). These are often different characters who are related or married, NOT the same person.
        - Characters with different titles but the same surname (like "Mr. Johnson" and "Mrs. Johnson") are almost always DIFFERENT people.
        - Standardize entity names by removing titles and using lowercase with underscores.
        - ALWAYS use the real name for the entity_name, NOT nicknames (e.g., use "miranda_bailey" not "the_nazi").
        - For the best_appellation, ALWAYS prefer the most formal version with title if available (e.g., "Dr. Miranda Bailey" is better than "Miranda Bailey" or "The Nazi").
        - If a character has a nickname, include it as an appellation but NEVER as the entity_name.
        - Split compound appellations like "Mr. and Mrs. Johnson" into separate entities: "mr_johnson" and "mrs_johnson".
        - NEVER mix gender-specific titles (Mr./Mrs./Miss/Ms.) for the same entity. If you see "Mr. Johnson" and "Mrs. Johnson", these are different people.
        - CRITICAL: NEVER include a common appellation (like just "Johnson") for entities with different gender-specific titles, as this could create confusion between different people with the same surname.
        - List all possible variations of the name as appellations.
        - If you're unsure about an entity, include it anyway with your best guess.
        - CRITICAL: You MUST include ALL entities from the extracted list. Do not skip or omit any entities.
        - For biological_sex: Use context clues, titles (Mr./Mrs./Ms./Miss), pronouns (he/she), and character names to determine biological sex. Use 'M' for male, 'F' for female, or null for unknown/unclear cases.
