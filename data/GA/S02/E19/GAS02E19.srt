00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,733
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,863
- Who's Mark?
- Derek found us in bed together.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,340
- How come you forgive her?
- I didn't forgive her.

4
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,140
Denny, this is Dr. Stevens. She'll
be tending to you prior to surgery.

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,840
That guy Alex, you with him?

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,178
- No.
- I won't have to fight him for you.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,115
Where is my husband?

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,210
Got into a car accident
trying to get here.

9
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,484
- This is our son.
- He's beautiful.

10
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,219
He broke up with me for a girl
who doesn't know he's alive.

11
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,989
You, Meredith Grey?
Never gonna happen.

12
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,394
You look sad.

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,728
I saw my father for the first time
in 20 years.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,861
- Is there anything that you need?
- I don't need anything from you.

15
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,565
You could just try
telling her how you feel.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,574
I will never stop loving you.

17
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:53,681
<i> OK, so sometimes</i>
<i>even the best of us make rash decisions.</i>

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,483
<i>Bad decisions.</i>

19
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,287
<i>Decisions we pretty much know</i>
<i>we're going to regret the moment...</i>

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,353
<i>the minute especially...</i>
<i>the morning after.</i>

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,799
<i>I mean, maybe not</i>
<i>"regret" regret because at least,</i>

22
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:13,669
<i>you know, we put ourselves out there,</i>
<i>but still,</i>

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,540
<i>something inside us</i>
<i>decides to do a crazy thing,</i>

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,047
<i>a thing we know will probably turn</i>
<i>around and bite us in the ass.</i>

25
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,107
<i>Yet... we do it anyway.</i>

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,817
I'm coming, Doc. Just hang on.
Just hold it until I get there, please.

27
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,157
- I'll walk him.
- No, it's my turn.

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,630
No, it's OK. I'll walk Doc.
You just sleep.

29
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:44,864
The good... fresh outdoors.
Spring morning.

30
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,236
- You just sleep.
- OK.

31
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,276
- Unless you wanna talk.
- Oh, God. Here it comes.

32
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:54,370
I'm not saying we have to talk. I'm just
saying if you want to talk, we could.

33
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,816
I can start and you can talk about
anything at all you want to talk about.

34
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,218
It's too early for me to interpret
"girl flip-out" into conversation.

35
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,657
It's just that usually you start
yelling when you get mad.

36
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,628
Mark showed up and you haven't yelled
yet and I'm trying to give you a chance.

37
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,597
- Just go. Yell.
- I don't wanna yell.

38
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,066
- You don't wanna yell? You?
- I just wanna sleep.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,162
Doc, he wants to pee.
Preferably not inside this trailer.

40
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,797
OK.

41
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,512
You could yell if you want to.
I can take it. I'm ready.

42
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,608
All right. I'm going.
I'm going. Come on.

43
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:39,055
<i> What I'm saying is...</i>
<i>we reap what we sow.</i>

44
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>What comes around, goes around.</i>

45
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,638
Morning. Morning.

46
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,876
What? So, I slept with him again.

47
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,011
So I'm a big whore. A big horny whore
who can't get enough.

48
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,487
Can we get over
the shocked silence already?

49
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,118
<i>It's karma. And any way you slice it...</i>

50
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,389
What's going on?

51
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,158
<i>... karma sucks.</i>

52
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,898
50 bucks says O'Malley caught
her doing Mark Sloan.

53
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,241
There's something going on.
Look at them.

54
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,716
All right.
He walked in on her doing McDreamy.

55
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,015
Did I just call that dude McDreamy?

56
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,114
- Oh, you know you did.
- Awesome. You are ruining my life.

57
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,659
- Uh-huh.
- Get a room.

58
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,319
- Guys?
- Excuse me.

59
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,226
Sorry.

60
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,356
What's going on?

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
- Nothing.
- You know we're gonna find out anyway.

62
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,406
- If you tell us, we can help.
- There's nothing to tell.

63
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,771
That means there's something to tell.

64
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,039
- Come on.
- There's nothing to tell.

65
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,208
Well, how about gardenias?
Like masses and mountains of gardenias.

66
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,116
- Are we worried about bees?
- That's why I love him.

67
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,553
- No gardenias.
- Who would like to present?

68
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,753
Keith Paulus. Admitted last night
with chest pain. Status: post acute MI.

69
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,261
No family or personal history
of heart disease.

70
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,627
- No cardiac risk factors.
- Healthy as a horse.

71
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,156
A horse who's in bed
after just having a heart attack.

72
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,331
Any minute, I think you're gonna
tell us that this was a false alarm.

73
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,170
- She talks when she gets nervous.
- I understand.

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,805
Mr. Paulus, unfortunately the scan
shows a mass around your heart.

75
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,145
A very, very large mass.

76
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,481
Mass. OK.

77
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,213
Is that code for tumor?

78
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,281
OK, that's absurd. He doesn't
have a tumor. He's incredibly healthy.

79
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,555
We won't know
without further exploration

80
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,995
which is why
I'd like to do an angiogram today.

81
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,896
OK. Good.

82
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,205
Did Meredith say anything to anyone
about anything?

83
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,509
- No. Are you going to dish?
- No. No.

84
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,572
Then leave me alone. I'm working.

85
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,210
Good. Because I don't
want to talk about it ever.

86
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,846
- Fine. Then don't.
- I'm just saying.

87
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,268
Why are you...? That's weird

88
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,838
You need to throw up again?
There's no shame in needing to throw up.

89
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,814
Dad, I don't need to throw up.

90
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,613
Shawn Begleiter, 11 years old. In
for vomiting after a minor head injury.

91
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,677
Oh, I wouldn't exactly say minor.

92
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,417
- He was hit with a baseball.
- Playing first.

93
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,483
This little dolt Harry Doppelhammer
hit this line drive

94
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,552
when Shawn wasn't looking...

95
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,829
This is my fault. I shouldn't
have let him play Little League.

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,392
- It's clearly a dangerous sport.
- Rick, let's let the doctors talk.

97
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,666
Michael, I'm telling them what happened.

98
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,265
Shawn's going to be OK. Right?

99
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,641
Yeah, we have to keep a close eye
on him. OK, recommendations?

100
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,978
It could indicate anything from a
concussion to intracranial hemorrhaging.

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,850
I'd start with an H and P,
do a thorough neuro exam, and get a CT.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,945
- Good.
- Sure you don't need to throw up?

103
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,649
Dad.

104
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,057
- Tucker.
- Dr. Shepherd.

105
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,571
How um... How are you feeling?

106
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,099
I'm feeling great. I get to go home!

107
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,611
That's fantastic.
Is Miranda going to meet you there?

108
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,273
- No, I'm driving him there.
- Oh, thank God.

109
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,147
- Are you OK?
- I need a consult.

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,789
- I'm not working.
- Miranda. I need a consult.

111
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,257
- Oh, no.
- Please don't say that.

112
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,892
Addison, I'm so, so sorry.

113
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:21,270
You have poison oak...
where nobody wants to have poison oak.

114
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,672
- <i> Like I was saying...</i>
- Oh, God!

115
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,472
<i>... payback's a bitch.</i>

116
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,620
It's official, my friend.
You get to go home.

117
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,054
I can't thank you enough.

118
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,185
I thank you, my wife thanks you...
and my son thanks you.

119
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,594
Where is your wife?
You can't drive for another six weeks.

120
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,226
Dr. Shepherd's a stickler when
it comes to patients' recovery. I know.

121
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,462
Hey, Richard.

122
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,266
Wanted to stop in
before Bailey took you home.

123
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,432
Well, she's here somewhere.

124
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,477
Your wife came in earlier.
Said she needed a consult.

125
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,603
Consult?
Bailey's on maternity leave.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,140
It seemed like some kind of personal
consult. It's OK. I don't mind waiting.

127
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,983
- All right. I'm back.
- Oh.

128
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,512
You didn't make a chart? Please tell me
you did not make up a chart?

129
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,922
I did not make up a chart,

130
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,655
so we are officially stealing
this calamine lotion and these gloves.

131
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,720
You take it up with the chief.

132
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,598
- I cannot take this up with the chief.
- I'm kidding.

133
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,637
Did I make jokes
when you were in the stirrups?

134
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,368
No, you did not. And I'm apologizing.

135
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,773
Oh, my.

136
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,744
- What?
- These blisters are growing fast.

137
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,646
- I gotta give you a shot of steroids.
- Steroids?

138
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,981
I have never seen
a case a poison oak this bad.

139
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,221
Ew! Girl, what did you...

140
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,452
Oh, for the love of God!
Miranda, the calamine!

141
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,857
Right. Sorry.

142
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,828
- What happened with you and O'Malley?
- Nothing.

143
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,558
Whatever it is, I've done worse.

144
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,692
How do you know I did something
and George didn't?

145
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,396
Because Bambi looks pissed
and you look guilty.

146
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,102
Here we are! Come on, buddy.
Let me help you up there.

147
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,972
There you go.

148
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,981
Fine, I did something.
A terrible, terrible something.

149
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,576
One time I put a raw egg in my sock
drawer for a month,

150
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,985
then I smashed
it in my teacher's grade book.

151
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,649
- Ew!
- My dads were really mad.

152
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,684
Well, what I did was worse than that.

153
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,093
- Cool.
- Cool.

154
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,942
- Stop pouting.
- I'm not pouting.

155
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,779
Oh, please. I don't even have to look
at you. I can feel you pouting.

156
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,115
Whatever Meredith did,
it wasn't on purpose, so get over it.

157
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,353
I am not being inappropriate. He's
acting like she's skinned his puppy.

158
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,021
- Yang, this is not nice.
- I'm not a nice person.

159
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,621
If you knew what she did
you would understand.

160
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,532
No, I don't understand.
I don't wanna know.

161
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,366
What I want
is to analyze this angiogram,

162
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,737
book this sucker into surgery
and excise his cardiothoracic mass.

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,176
- Doesn't look like a mass to me.
- That's because it's not.

164
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:19,817
What we thought was a mass
is actually a coronary artery aneurysm

165
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,410
with a fistula
into one of your heart chambers.

166
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,252
Is that, uh, easy to fix?

167
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,124
Before you answer that, I want you
to know that we're getting married.

168
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,130
We're getting married
and we're not so young,

169
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,462
so we've been waiting
a long time for this.

170
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,524
I have my dress and everyone's coming

171
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,162
and it's supposed to be
the happiest day of our lives.

172
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:43,106
I'm telling you this because
you have this look on your face,

173
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:47,009
this dark, ominous look,
and we're silver-lining kind of people.

174
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,547
So I just thought it might help
if you knew that.

175
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,015
Dr. Yang? Would you close the door?

176
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,319
Well, we can...
We can operate on the aneurysm,

177
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,186
try to repair it,

178
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,283
but this type of lesion
is extremely delicate.

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,660
Chances of it rupturing
in surgery are high.

180
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,297
What keeps if from rupturing
if I'm just walking down the street?

181
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,338
Nothing. The risks are high either way.

182
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,675
This isn't happening.
This can't be happening.

183
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,304
- It's OK, Amy.
- No, it's not.

184
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,611
I know it's a lot to process,
but if we're going to operate,

185
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,845
we need to do it as soon as possible.

186
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,552
- We're getting married.
- Honey.

187
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,217
We're getting... We're getting married.

188
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,954
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

189
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,100
They seem like a really nice couple.
They don't seem like they deserve this.

190
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,866
- They never do.
- Really?

191
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,400
I guess I just think...
I believe in karma.

192
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,445
You know,
good people deserve good things.

193
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,504
At least I thought
that's the way the universe worked.

194
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,415
How can you think that
and practice medicine?

195
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,511
Why...

196
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,421
I'm not saying that everybody who
gets sick or everybody who dies is bad.

197
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,688
I'm just saying that
I think that there's a balance.

198
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,822
Or there should be a balance.
There should be some sort of balance.

199
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,364
Good God, O'Malley,
what the hell did Grey do to you?

200
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,936
What do you mean
when you say blood in the ventricle?

201
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,501
Oh, my God! His brain is bleeding?

202
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,344
There's no need to panic.
It's a small amount of blood.

203
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,044
These injuries often resolve themselves.

204
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,213
But what if it doesn't?
Will he lose IQ points?

205
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,553
He's very smart. That's important
to him. He likes to be smart.

206
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,116
Should we sue that little brute
that hit the ball?

207
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,255
- Or the coach, should we sue the coach?
- Shawn loves the coach.

208
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,199
- Shawn's brain is bleeding.
- Rick...

209
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,065
Dad. I'm fine. Jeez.

210
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,264
Yeah, he's awake, alert, minimal pain.

211
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,399
These are good signs.
I just want to monitor him for 48 hours.

212
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,536
OK. Good.
Hear that Shawn? Good signs.

213
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,138
That means, honey,
you shouldn't be scared.

214
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,409
- I'm not.
- I am.

215
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,280
We know.

216
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,947
They paged you too?
Must be something big.

217
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,425
- Nobody paged me.
- They didn't? Can you tie this?

218
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,793
- Nobody paged you either.
- Yes, they did. I just got a...

219
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,764
Did you page me? Alex...

220
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,698
Ooh!

221
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,003
- You free tonight?
- I might be.

222
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,173
- Are you still working with Meredith?
- I'm trying to kiss you here.

223
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,202
Did she say anything about her and
George? I'm starting to get worried...

224
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,841
35-year-old male, shortness of breath.

225
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,318
- Pulse is rapid and irregular.
- Oh, my God. It's Denny.

226
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,184
- What?
- It's Denny.

227
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,994
- What'd he get in the field?
- He's my patient until I sign him over.

228
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,696
I know him. He's on top of the list for
a new heart. That makes him surgical.

229
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,331
Dr. Burke's on his way,
so you'd better start signing.

230
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,931
What did he get in the field?

231
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,307
40 of furosemide. Rhythm didn't change
after six of adenosine.

232
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,936
- What do we got?
- It's Denny.

233
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:12,006
Transplant candidate, acute dysrhythmia
and CHF. Vitals all over the place.

234
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,781
- His heart rhythm is a mess.
- He's in heart failure.

235
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,846
Bisoprolol can reduce mortality.

236
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,415
What about ACE inhibitors? And digoxin.
Somebody load him with dig!

237
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,724
Slow down. He's holding on.
Barely, but he's holding on.

238
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,027
There has to be something more
we can do.

239
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,126
The best we can do is get him up to CICU
and see if his heart will stabilize.

240
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,162
- Izzie, we should go.
- No, you go. I'm gonna stay.

241
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,213
- No. Yes, yes.
- I see you.

242
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,052
No, you don't.

243
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,853
Your husband was discharged
over an hour ago.

244
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,860
- I'm not here.
- Go home.

245
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,260
You're not working.
You're on maternity leave.

246
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,319
Exactly.

247
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:10,571
- Have you made your decision?
- Oh! Uh, about the surgery?

248
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:15,512
Um... No, we're still...
We're still talking about it.

249
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,574
We were thinking maybe we should
wait until after the wedding.

250
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,214
- So how is he?
- He's pretty much the same.

251
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,819
- Well, that's good, right?
- Uh, no. Not really. It...

252
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,960
With your condition,
you're gonna be OK until you're not.

253
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,629
If you opt against the surgery
and leave, it's just a matter of time.

254
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,537
You might make it to your wedding,
but you might not.

255
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,734
You're just gonna be OK until you die.

256
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,040
What...
You're trying to comfort me?

257
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,980
No. I'm trying to convince you
to let Dr. Burke operate.

258
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,915
So that he can die today?

259
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,183
He might die today anyway.
But Dr. Burke is the very best.

260
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,417
And he's your very best chance.

261
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,726
...5.0. WC: 13,700.

262
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,233
Stevens, everything all right?

263
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,538
Oh, it's just...

264
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,240
It's just not fair.
You know, it's really not fair.

265
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,272
We treat... jerks all the time.

266
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,286
Patch them up, send them off, whether
they deserve it or not. No big deal.

267
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:35,020
But Denny...
He's a good guy, Dr. Burke.

268
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,188
He's a really good guy with a bad heart

269
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,925
and all we can do for him is wait.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,969
Believe me, I know.
I've been treating Denny a long time.

271
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,597
He didn't deserve this.

272
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,005
He deserves the best cardiac care
and we're giving him that.

273
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,679
You really like him, don't you?

274
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,841
He just...

275
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,488
He just doesn't deserve this.

276
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,454
OK.

277
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,494
All right. How's that?
Is that ice pack helping?

278
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,863
I don't know. I don't think so.

279
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,064
Mind if I ask
how exactly this happened?

280
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,838
- I slept with Mark!
- Oh! And he had poison oak on his...

281
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,676
No! I slept with Mark a year ago.
And, apparently, this is what I get.

282
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,409
Yeah. But how did you...

283
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,749
I live in a trailer.
I have Meredith Grey's dog.

284
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,757
And I went outside to throw a stick
and I had to pee. So I squatted.

285
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,953
I didn't want to go inside
and wake up my husband

286
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:48,022
because the way he's been looking at me,
I just wanted a few minutes of peace.

287
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,331
- This is what I get!
- No, no, no. Don't cry.

288
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,066
Don't cry. Please don't cry!
Please don't cry!

289
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,836
Stop! You're gonna make me...

290
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,614
lactate.

291
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:09,518
- Can you give some gauze? Here. Quick.
- I'm sorry.

292
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,681
Just stop!

293
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,124
Can I help you, chief?

294
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,629
Dr. Bailey...

295
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,894
I don't know what you're doing in there,
but whatever it is...

296
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,201
Oh.

297
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,638
Oh, no. Um...

298
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:32,200
Dr. Bailey, uh, I'm... sorry.

299
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,944
Carry on.

300
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,446
OK, fill me in.

301
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,489
I was doing his routine neuro check.
I noticed he was altered.

302
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,286
Most likely a clot. Acute hydrocephalus.

303
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,056
- We need to relieve the pressure.
- Cranial access kit's ready.

304
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,099
Cranial access?
Access to Shawn's brain?

305
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,033
- Debbie, get them out of here.
- Gentlemen.

306
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,763
- Rick...
- We're not going.

307
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,704
I'm about to drill a hole
into your son's skull.

308
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,472
He's our son. We're not leaving.
We are not leaving his side!

309
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,606
15 blade. I want a catheter ready to
drain as soon as I penetrate the dura.

310
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,242
Do not panic. I want the drill.

311
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,825
Almost... OK.

312
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,598
Look at that. OK. Catheter quickly.

313
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,973
- Pupil's reactive.
- Pressure stabilizing.

314
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,603
- Is he OK?
- I want neuro checks every hour.

315
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,670
- We're in the clear for now.
- In the clear?

316
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,616
- You guys did well.
- I have a headache.

317
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,550
Welcome back.

318
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,182
911.

319
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,522
Dad, you look white. Are you OK?

320
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,297
Oh, great.

321
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,030
Yes.

322
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,040
You got here quick.

323
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,547
We gotta get his heart rate
under control. Push 300 of amiodarone.

324
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,242
- Status?
- Atrial fibrillation.

325
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,842
His heart's beating too fast.
If we can't slow it...

326
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,477
It'll give out.

327
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,684
All right. Let's try synchronized
cardioversion. Push five of morphine.

328
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,357
Izzie?

329
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,057
- You're awake.
- Hey.

330
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,725
I was hoping I might get to see you.

331
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,996
You're working us pretty hard.

332
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,903
The things I have to do
to get a girl's attention.

333
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,272
Denny, we're about to send
electric currents through your body.

334
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,506
Hopefully, the shocks will be enough
to slow your heart rate.

335
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,377
- I'll be here the whole time.
- Is it going to hurt?

336
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:55,352
- It won't be fun.
- Maybe you oughta hold my hand then.

337
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,048
- Mind if I handle the paddles?
- Be my guest.

338
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,760
- Ready?
- Yeah. Hit me.

339
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,627
Clear.

340
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,626
No change. Try it at 100.

341
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,597
Clear!

342
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,372
Holy smoke!

343
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,279
Denny, you are a lucky man.

344
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,649
Oh, Doc. I oughta kick your ass,

345
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,383
making me yell like a baby in front
of the girl I'm trying to impress.

346
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,425
Oh! Jeez!

347
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,726
Take care, man.

348
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Dr. Bailey. Dr. Bailey!
Didn't you hear me?

349
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,864
- I'm a little distracted right now.
- Oh, yes. I've been paging you.

350
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,932
I'm not on call. I'm on maternity leave.

351
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,446
I've been paging my wife as well.
You know where she is.

352
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,607
Just because I know
doesn't mean you should.

353
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,813
There's some things you don't get to
know. And, really, you don't wanna know.

354
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,118
You have to tell me where she is.
I saved your husband's life.

355
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,988
- She saved my baby.
- So baby trumps husband?

356
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,922
Baby trumps husband?

357
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,182
Hey, Amy.

358
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,388
The website said
that you should save your receipts.

359
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,158
- I'm sorry?
- Just in case something happens.

360
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,496
You know, to have them.
I have all of ours right here.

361
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,298
I've got, you know,
I've got my dress and the band

362
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,965
and I've got the ballroom deposit
and honeymoon.

363
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,339
My mom said I shouldn't keep them.
Said it was bad luck.

364
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,470
It was... It was tempting fate.

365
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,545
This isn't your fault.

366
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:12,523
You have a life. You fall in love.
You make plans. You have fantasies.

367
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:20,559
And none of them
involve all of them ending

368
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,463
in a blink of the eye.

369
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,747
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.

370
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,118
All right. So you slept with O'Malley.
Get over it already.

371
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,352
- He told you?
- Uh... no.

372
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,796
Oh, I was just kidding. I mean,
it's not like I should be surprised.

373
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,026
Why not?

374
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,092
Because when your life is sucking,

375
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,401
you get drunk and sleep with
inappropriate men. It's your thing.

376
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,031
Whatever. I find it charming.

377
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,305
You sleep with inappropriate women
when you're sober.

378
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,347
One inappropriate woman.
And Izzie forgave me for that.

379
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,212
- O'Malley won't get over this.
- She hasn't forgiven you.

380
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,310
- Yes, she has. We're together.
- No, you're not.

381
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:19,448
Izzie will never see you the way she
saw you before you slept with Olivia.

382
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,082
Why are you trying to piss me off?

383
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,287
You're suggesting it's forgivable
for you to sleep with Olivia,

384
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,262
but not for for me to sleep with George.

385
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,562
- You told him? I...
- George!

386
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,001
When I am wrong about someone,
I am really wrong!

387
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,438
- No, George! It's not what you think.
- Dude, chill.

388
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,410
You chill! You chill!
I'm not gonna chill!

389
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,743
- George. I...
- What's going on?

390
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,907
- Fetus is freaking out.
- Why?

391
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,441
You think that someone is...
your friend.

392
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,284
And that at the very least
she will respect your privacy!

393
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,153
- What's going on?
- He's freaking out.

394
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,160
- She can see that.
- Why is he freaking out?

395
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,959
- George, can we at least talk?
- I don't wanna talk. Not to you!

396
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,658
I wanted to keep my mouth shut!

397
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:05,362
And if you hadn't been running away
from me, you would know that!

398
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,530
OK, you're right, but can we talk now?

399
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,303
You want to talk now because
you told everyone that we had sex!

400
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,675
- You had sex?
- You had sex with George?

401
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,044
- You didn't tell them?
- No.

402
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,013
- Damn it!
- George!

403
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,317
George!

404
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,969
Go away.

405
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,378
He's gonna be OK, right?

406
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,008
He dislocated his shoulder.
He's gonna be fine.

407
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,848
That's not exactly what I meant.

408
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,454
Meredith,
if you can't make this right,

409
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,994
if you can't fix this with George...

410
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,530
Just so you know,
if it comes to choosing sides...

411
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,159
I'm on his.

412
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,068
He's the weaker kid.

413
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,411
I mean, even I don't beat up
on weaker kids. It's cheap.

414
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,341
I did a terrible thing.

415
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,183
I didn't...

416
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,053
I did a terrible thing.

417
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:35,286
He's been in love with you since day
one. There's no way you didn't know.

418
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,165
- We all do terrible things.
- Thank you.

419
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,963
You're welcome.

420
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,569
- George O'Malley?
- Uh, hi.

421
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,145
Dr. O'Malley.
The heart-in-the-elevator guy.

422
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,478
- Yeah, that's me.
- That was amazing.

423
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,713
Uh, thanks.
I dislocated my shoulder.

424
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,151
- Yeah.
- Oh!

425
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,657
- I can see that.
- It's really not so bad.

426
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,990
Yes it is. Pick your poison.

427
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,791
Uh... No painkillers, thanks.

428
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,391
- Bold choice.
- No. Officially I'm on duty.

429
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,867
- And planning to stay?
- Mm-hm.

430
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,496
Bolder choice.

431
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,006
All I need is help...
popping it back in.

432
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:33,644
- You got into a fight?
- I fell down some stairs.

433
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,448
- Where? At your girlfriend's?
- Wha...

434
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,513
- No, I'm single.
- Single, huh?

435
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,595
Hurts less if you don't see it coming.

436
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,018
- All set?
- All set.

437
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,519
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

438
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,255
- Bye.
- Bye.

439
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,067
- Don't.
- Don't?

440
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,640
Don't be nice to me.

441
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,867
I did a terrible thing.

442
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,243
- We all do terrible things.
- No. I...

443
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,808
I did a thing
that I can't even believe I did and...

444
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,954
I was sad and...

445
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,491
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna lose all my friends.

446
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,494
You won't lose me.

447
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,129
- You're not my friend.
- Yes, I am.

448
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,765
Well... I could be.

449
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,599
I'm a very good friend.

450
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,163
No. We can't be friends.

451
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,074
We could be friends.
You'd be lucky to have me.

452
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,113
How? How can we be friends?

453
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,410
We could uh...

454
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,175
hang out.

455
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,620
I walk Doc every other morning,
Tiger Mountain trail.

456
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,955
We could meet,
have coffee, watch Doc play and...

457
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,654
discuss the complex nature
of our existence.

458
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,994
- Right.
- We could. Might be fun.

459
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:32,935
- I could be your friend, Meredith.
- No. We can't be friends.

460
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,643
Just adding nitro.
Your blood pressure's stable now,

461
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,448
your CHF is improved
and the atrial fibrillation resolved.

462
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,820
- I like the way you say fibrillation.
- Fibrillation.

463
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,224
- Tease.
- How are you feeling?

464
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,889
You, uh... You believe in karma?

465
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,896
Um... Actually, I do, yeah.

466
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,801
I think you might be mine.

467
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,603
You must have been
very, very good to deserve me.

468
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,736
I must have.

469
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,071
OK.

470
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,447
- I wouldn't do that.
- Dr. Bailey...

471
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,720
If she wants privacy,
we will give her privacy. Understood?

472
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,091
- Dr. Bailey paged me.
- She did?

473
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,131
- Yeah.
- I did. And I'm still not here.

474
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,293
I'm still on maternity leave
and I still need privacy.

475
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,359
Come here.

476
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,870
No peeking, no pulling the curtain.

477
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,376
Stand there. Let her talk to you.
Understand?

478
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,311
- Is this really necessary?
- Do you understand?

479
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,578
- I'm not mentally challenged.
- I'm not sure about that. Let her talk.

480
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,949
- Addison, this is ridiculous.
- Stay where you are! Promise!

481
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,490
OK, I promise.

482
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,755
I'm going to show you something
and when I do,

483
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,820
you do not get to laugh
and you do not get to gloat.

484
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,662
- Why would I gloat?
- I have poison oak.

485
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,400
What?

486
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,742
Mm. You do indeed have poison oak.

487
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:29,782
So are we even yet? Is this bad enough?
Have I repaid my debt to society, Derek?

488
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,494
- Let's take a look.
- Ow!

489
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,837
Oh.

490
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,504
Good morning, Tuck.
Let's take your daddy home.

491
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,578
Hm? Oh...

492
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,582
She really didn't tell you about it?

493
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,848
No. God, is that a bad thing?

494
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,687
She tells you everything. It didn't
matter enough to her to talk about it.

495
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,522
OK, George. The pity thing? Not good.

496
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,188
If you want crappy things
to stop happening to you,

497
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,096
then stop accepting crap
and demand something more.

498
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,658
Hey, Amy.

499
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:22,536
Oh, could you tell Dr. Burke
that Keith is gonna have the surgery?

500
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,632
- Great.
- Where are you going?

501
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,577
Um, I...
I'm not strong enough for this.

502
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,275
Amy, I know it's hard, but your fiancé
is going in to surgery.

503
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,251
You're gonna want to be here
when he wakes up.

504
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,686
No, I won't. Um...

505
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,989
He's not my fiancé anymore.

506
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,954
- You're leaving him?
- I'm not strong enough for this.

507
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,090
So the "in sickness and in health"
part of your vows...

508
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,101
you were planning to leave those out?

509
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,262
Please try to understand.

510
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:58,935
I don't like that I'm not strong enough.
I just know that I'm not.

511
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,739
- George, he's crashing!
- What?

512
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,337
His aneurysm may have blown.
Page Dr. Burke!

513
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,987
OK, everyone.

514
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,998
It's actually
a coronary-artery aneurysm.

515
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,967
- He's gonna live?
- Burke's a miracle-worker.

516
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,133
D'you know this guy's fiancée left him?

517
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,109
Sounds like he dodged a bullet.

518
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,712
I don't think
he's gonna see it that way.

519
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,654
If she can't love him back
the way he loves her...

520
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,021
then she doesn't deserve him.

521
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,662
- You heard about me and Meredith?
- Well, everyone heard, George.

522
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,758
You were yelling about it
in the hallway.

523
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,798
Must have sucked. I'm sorry.

524
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,874
I'm sorry.

525
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,946
If I made you feel anything
like I'm feeling right now...

526
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,486
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,457
That's nice to hear.

528
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,797
</i>

529
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,738
- How's that?
- It was good. Really good.

530
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,644
Because, uh... I could do it again.

532
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,246
I like doing it.

533
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,480
- No, it's good.
- I could do it until you...

534
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,044
No, it's OK. I'm ready.

535
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,759
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

536
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,294
OK. It's OK.

537
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,127
- There.
- Right there?

538
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,292
Meredith.

539
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,767
George.

540
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,879
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

541
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,975
Nothing's wrong.
Why would you think anything's wrong?

542
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,818
- You're crying.
- No. It'll stop. Just ignore me.

543
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,082
I can't ignore you.

544
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,721
Yeah, yeah.
It's fine. It's fine. Just...

545
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,957
It's OK. You're almost done, right?

546
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
No.

547
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,996
- George.
- Meredith...

548
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,000
George, please.

549
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,572
Sleeping with me
is really this awful for you?

550
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,245
No, George! It's not!

551
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,649
It's not you!

552
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,564
George!

553
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,340
There's a suitcase in the hall.

554
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,406
I was just getting my shirt.

555
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,345
- There's a suitcase...
- Yeah, uh...

556
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,117
I don't live here anymore. Excuse me.

557
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,231
Why?

558
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,291
I just wanna know why you...

559
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:24,072
- If you didn't want to...
- I didn't know I didn't want to.

560
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,835
You were there.

561
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,405
And you were saying
all these perfect things and I was sad.

562
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,576
And so I thought, maybe...

563
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,715
Maybe I've just been overlooking
what's been in front of me.

564
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,754
And if I just give it a chance,

565
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,628
because you're George
and you're so great...

566
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,137
I didn't know I didn't want to
until I knew I didn't want to.

567
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,042
Yeah.

568
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,770
OK.

569
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,149
Can we please just go back
to everything the way it was?

570
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,447
I don't know how to go back.

571
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,422
No. I'm done.

572
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,695
We're done.

573
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,135
<i>One way or another, our karma...</i>

574
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,809
<i>will leave us to face ourselves.</i>

575
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,479
<i>We can look our karma in the eye</i>

576
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,575
<i>or we can wait for it</i>
<i>to sneak up on us from behind.</i>

577
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,449
- You ready?
- What?

578
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,649
Aren't we...
I thought we had plans for tonight.

579
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,016
Oh. I forgot. I'm sorry.

580
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,461
- Rain check?
- Sure.

581
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,837
Amy?

582
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,177
She's not... here.

583
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,878
But you are. That's what's important.

584
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,117
She left?

585
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,422
She really left.

586
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,700
Who does that?

587
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,735
What kind of person does that?

588
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:46,182
<i> One way or another</i>
<i>our karma will always find us.</i>

589
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,919
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

590
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,890
Wow.

591
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:02,096
I gotta say, not exactly how
I'd envisioned our perfect first date.

592
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,463
Are you kidding?

593
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,231
Do you know how hard I've had to work
to get a cute boy in bed before?

594
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,701
You think I'm cute.

595
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,840
OK. Shut up and drink your juice.

596
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,245
<i>And the truth is, as surgeons...</i>

597
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:24,148
<i>we have more chances than most</i>
<i>to set the balance in our favor.</i>

598
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:27,122
- George?
- Dr. Torres.

599
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,525
Callie.

600
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,459
- You going on a trip?
- Sorta.

601
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,367
Well, in that case...

602
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:46,200
Give me a call
when you get back in town.

603
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,958
<i>No matter how hard we try,</i>
<i>we can't escape our karma.</i>

604
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,564
<i>It follows us home.</i>

605
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,866
He's your friend
and he needed our help.

606
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,776
- Are his problems surgical?
- No.

607
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,838
Then, technically,
he doesn't need our help.

608
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,682
- You're a good person.
- I am not.

609
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,024
- Good night.
- Oh, good night.

610
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,658
Good night!

611
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,337
<i>I guess we can't really</i>
<i>complain about karma.</i>

612
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,968
<i>It's not unfair, it's not unexpected.</i>

613
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,740
<i>It just... evens the score.</i>

614
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,416
Good boy. Good boy.

615
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,286
<i>Even when we're about to do something</i>

616
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,595
<i>we know will tempt karma</i>
<i>to bite us in the ass...</i>

617
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,135
<i>Well, it goes without saying...</i>

618
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,036
- So...
- So...

619
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,937
Just friends.

620
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,469
Just friends.

621
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,570
<i>... we do it anyway.</i>
