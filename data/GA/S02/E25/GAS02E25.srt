00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,063
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:05,000
- I didn't get the heart.
- You didn't.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,732
I cannot fall for a patient.

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,673
What's going on between Stevens
and Denny? Is it a crush?

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,540
An innocent flirtation?
Or is Stevens crossing the line?

6
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:16,069
I'm considering the possibility
of maybe having a date with a vet.

7
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:17,775
Is he sick again?

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,750
He was listless
and hadn't eaten all day.

9
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,379
Those girls were staring at me
like I was a rodent.

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:26,721
- I'm a surgeon first, just like you.
- No. Not like me. I am a person first.

11
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,851
If Burke forgave me
for sleeping during sex...

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,294
- Burke hasn't forgiven you.
- You left me.

13
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,127
You don't get to call me a whore.

14
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,963
This thing with us is finished.
It's over.

15
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,571
<i>In life, we are taught
that there are seven deadly sins.</i>

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,232
Let's see what you got here.

17
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,870
<i>We all know the big ones:
Gluttony, pride, lust.</i>

18
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:53,310
He's picturing my face. He's totally
picturing that dart puncturing my skull.

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>But the sin you don't hear much about
is anger.</i>

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,450
Whoa! Look at that.

21
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,960
<i>Maybe it's because we think
anger's not that dangerous.</i>

22
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,554
Derek... Derek is picturing you.

23
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,327
<i>That we can control it.</i>

24
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,029
He called me a whore.
He lost the right to picture me.

25
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:14,664
- Hmm.
- So I fall asleep during sex. So what?

26
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,869
Ass.

27
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,239
Ass.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,904
Oh, ass! Hey!

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,005
Isabel Stevens has left the hospital.

30
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,312
Did heart patient dude finally kick it?

31
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:29,184
I'm sorry. This section of the bar
is for surgeons.

32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,655
We don't socialize with gynecologists.

33
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:37,322
George!

34
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:41,025
<i>My point is, maybe we don't
give anger enough credit.</i>

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,397
- Hey.
- Hi, Callie.

36
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:43,730
Hi, Dr. Torres.

37
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:47,261
<i>Maybe it can be a lot more dangerous
than we think.</i>

38
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,206
<i>After all,
when it comes to destructive behavior...</i>

39
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,176
Uh, gin and tonic and a beer.

40
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,974
<i>...it did make the top seven.</i>

41
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,245
That's it? That's your diagnosis?

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,811
He said bone cancer,
so that would be his diagnosis.

43
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,016
I heard him. I was double checking.

44
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,361
I still need to do a bone scan
to see how far it's spread.

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,093
Osteosarcomas are aggressive,
but we can try and treat it with chemo

46
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,930
or remove the tumor entirely.

47
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:20,438
If it's spread too far,
we may have to amputate the limb.

48
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:24,374
- At that point, should we even bother?
- Oh, right. Let's just let him die.

49
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:27,310
- I don't want him to suffer, Meredith.
- Right.

50
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:33,711
So what's...
I mean, is there something going on?

51
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,651
No.

52
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:38,246
- Did you guys have a fight?
- No.

53
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,325
So... we're all still... friends?

54
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,226
Yes.

55
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:56,069
I heard you might be getting a heart.
For a transplant.

56
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,701
Mercy West has a heart
and I'm going to get it, yes.

57
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:02,747
Can I go?
Because, um, I've done it before.

58
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,306
With Dr. Bailey,
when she went to get a heart.

59
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,511
You can ask her. I was very helpful.

60
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:11,420
Yeah, I'm sure you were. But I'm not
going to need your help on this one.

61
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,429
White male. GSW to the left shoulder.

62
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,660
Multiple walking wounded.
Five injured coming in behind us.

63
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,828
- Why are they all in the hallway?
- Overflow from the ER.

64
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,395
An employee went postal.
Shot up a restaurant.

65
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,532
- I heard he got away.
- Really?

66
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:33,169
Neal Hannigan and Deborah Fleiss.
They were paying when he came in.

67
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:36,544
She's got a through and through
to the right arm. Good distal pulses.

68
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:39,345
He's sustained a possible graze wound
to the right back.

69
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:43,718
Let's irrigate the wound and get them
to X-ray and order a tet-tox for both.

70
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,190
- Take care of my Deborah first.
- Oh, now you're concerned.

71
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,227
I said I was sorry.

72
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,128
The shooting starts, you duck behind me
and you're sorry?

73
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,324
- You ducked behind her?
- It was instinct.

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,891
I couldn't help it.
Deb, honey, you know I love you.

75
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,666
Love means never having to use
your girlfriend as a human shield!

76
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,902
We shared a bullet, Deborah.
It went through you and into me!

77
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,467
That's a sign we should
be together forever. A sign.

78
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:11,244
No, Neal, this is a sign!
She's squirting water through my arm.

79
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,878
Look. I can see you through my arm.
That's another sign!

80
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,717
Good luck.

81
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,226
Lower left leg deformity from GSW.
Pedal pulse is strong and intact.

82
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,989
Paramedics said he got five of morphine
in the field.

83
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,725
- Trust me, it was not enough.
- Probably got the tibia.

84
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,324
Rule out other injuries
then get him up to Radiology.

85
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,930
Let's get her up to CT.
Get a hold of her parents.

86
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,303
Get them down here.
What's her name, by the way?

87
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,605
- Kendra. Kendra Thomas.
- Kendra.

88
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,448
Almost... Got it.

89
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,080
Do you know what you're doing?
Because that really hurts.

90
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:52,590
You know what really hurts?
Gunshot wounds. You're lucky.

91
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,717
There's no luck.
Quick thinking, doll.

92
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,090
Excuse me?

93
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,527
I'm a quick thinker. Smart.
Always right on it.

94
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,691
As soon as I saw him,
Petey... he's the shooter...

95
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,792
I knew when I fired him he was no good.

96
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,133
Soon as I saw him,
I thought, "Oh, here we go. "

97
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,298
I just knew it was coming.

98
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,777
Hey, Chaz. Larry. No offense, but you
guys got to think quicker on your feet.

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,311
They have gunshot wounds.
Very serious gunshot wounds.

100
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,648
Life threatening gunshot wounds.

101
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,519
Really helps that I'm an athlete because
the second I saw Petey with that gun,

102
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,321
I was like cat-quick.
Just dove right through the window.

103
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,589
Those guys? Not so smart.

104
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,564
I'm going to take a guess
and say Petey was looking for you.

105
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,394
You seen any enema kits?

106
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,167
We have 13 GSWs.
You're looking for enema kits?

107
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,074
I'm trapped with the gyno-beast
on the uterus parade.

108
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,977
- Addison can't do this to you forever.
- You want to bet?

109
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,379
Swear to God,
she's ruining vaginas for me.

110
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,542
Two dead, 14 injured. The policemen
say the gunman got away

111
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,815
so there could be more incoming.

112
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,982
I could stay. We could send Bailey.

113
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,687
No. You're our only
cardiothoracic transplant specialist.

114
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,752
You go get that heart.

115
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,428
Oh, forget it, Karev. I already asked.

116
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,331
It's not going to... happen.

117
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,838
Dr. Burke!

118
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,042
Dr. Burke!

119
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,511
I heard you were getting a heart.
Can I go with you?

120
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,979
I asked first.

121
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,346
You didn't get assigned
to any gunshot cases?

122
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:29,080
Well, yeah, but if you had put me on
this when I asked I would've been free.

123
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,179
- I didn't.
- He's on the gynie squad!

124
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,383
Not if you put me on this transplant.

125
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,519
Please.

126
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,557
- Let's go, Karev.
- You can't be serious!

127
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:43,726
Whoo! See you later, Yang. Whoo!

128
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,809
So who's the lucky patient?

129
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,545
Denny Duquette.

130
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,173
The answer is no, Stevens.

131
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,146
You don't know what I'm going to ask.

132
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,739
You want to help prep Denny Duquette
for transplant.

133
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,717
So it's true? He's getting a heart then?

134
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,913
See, your face right now?

135
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,855
That's the problem.
You're overly attached to your patient.

136
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,223
So the answer is no, you cannot
prep him. Go back to sutures.

137
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,591
I know Denny's cardiac parameters.

138
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:48,326
I know how his LVAD works
better than any other intern.

139
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,890
I know his meds better.

140
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:53,836
I know the frequency, the dosage, the
quantity, and his physical limitations.

141
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,239
I promise I will...
I will be 100% professional.

142
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,040
No flirting, no knitting him sweaters,
no marathon games of Scrabble?

143
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,480
I will treat him with the same protocol
I would any other patient.

144
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,813
All right. Fine.
You can inform him the heart's coming.

145
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,790
- Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
- If you so much as sit on that bed...

146
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,087
I got it!

147
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,135
Can you imagine?
You're at work, you're doing your job

148
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,868
and somebody comes in and shoots you.
Just... puts a bullet in your head.

149
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,502
- 19 years old.
- Her parents are on their way. Also...

150
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,739
We need to get her
into the OR immediately.

151
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,407
- The bullet's gone through the midline.
- Also, uh...

152
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,610
Look at the size of the hematoma. Also?

153
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,711
- What?
- You said "also" twice.

154
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,348
Yeah. Also, she's pregnant.

155
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,724
Hey, I'm management,
so I'm 100% covered.

156
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,027
So I could spend a year in this
hospital, wouldn't cost me a cent.

157
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:57,000
When I told you about management,
you should've listened.

158
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,969
Because now you're screwed.

159
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:02,438
Even if you just spend one day
in this ER, that's three months' rent.

160
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,675
You want to be 16-year-old...

161
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,577
Is there any chance
you can, please, up my morphine?

162
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,514
He keeps talking,
pretty soon I'm going to need some.

163
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,309
Can you find out about Kendra for me?

164
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,047
Are you two friends?

165
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,113
Not friends, exactly.
But, uh, everybody likes her.

166
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,888
You know,
she's... she's just... she's nice.

167
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:26,294
She'll cover your shift when you
need it. She's good with customers.

168
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,959
She's real generous
when it comes to tipping busboys.

169
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,059
- Let me guess. You're a busboy?
- I am.

170
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:34,572
Plus, she's the only one
that calls Brad on his crap.

171
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,369
Well, why don't you say something?

172
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,908
Yeah, I wish.

173
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,843
I'm saving up to go back to school.
I need the job.

174
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,905
What are you, socializing?

175
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,712
I've got five more patients for you to
see and Will needs to get to surgery.

176
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,753
Move your ass.

177
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,322
I need the job.

178
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,859
- I have some news for you.
- Am I getting a better television?

179
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,731
Because this one is ridiculously small
and it doesn't get the porny channels.

180
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,031
You're getting a heart, Denny.

181
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,807
I don't mean to be dramatic and all...

182
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,439
but I'm going to need you
to repeat that.

183
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,643
And you say it slow, because this is
one of those moments in life

184
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,345
that I'm going to want to remember
in detail.

185
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:26,114
You... are getting a heart...

186
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,592
from Mercy West.
Dr. Burke already left to get it.

187
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:34,257
I guess this means I'm going to have to
start taking you on some real dates.

188
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,732
I guess so.

189
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,065
Here we are, Mr. Duquette.

190
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,401
- What are these?
- DNR papers.

191
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,408
Do not resuscitate?

192
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,444
I'll leave these here and come back.

193
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,472
Why are you signing these?
You're getting a heart.

194
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,984
- If this heart doesn't come through...
- It will.

195
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:58,648
- The last one didn't.
- You're on an LVAD.

196
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,887
That could give you
another two years right there.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,024
Izzie... if I don't get this heart...
I'm done.

198
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,501
I'm... I'm sorry... I'm tired.

199
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,568
No. No. I'm not going to let you
make this decision. Not now.

200
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:21,339
Well, that's funny because I thought DNR
was a patient's choice.

201
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,283
Listen to me.

202
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,281
I believe in heaven, Izzie.

203
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:37,693
And if I had to choose
between this life here...

204
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,396
and one in heaven...

205
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,362
I choose heaven. OK?

206
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,272
OK.

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,345
OK, the X-rays will tell us
the location of the bullet.

208
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,981
Mine was a through and through,
so there's no bullet.

209
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,752
We'll make sure it didn't hit bone.

210
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,623
Whatever happens, I want you
to operate on my fiancée first.

211
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,219
- I don't care if I'm dying.
- You're not dying.

212
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,458
I'm also not your fiancée anymore.

213
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,798
We sent out the invitations.
We're getting married in six weeks.

214
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,064
Deborah, please.

215
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:23,467
I love you.

216
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,340
- Oh, don't fall for it.
- Excuse me, but...

217
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:30,074
That's how they do it, huh? With the "I
love you's" and the "move in with me's"

218
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:32,412
and they suck you in
and they melt your resolve.

219
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:35,248
The minute you need something,
something you deserve,

220
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,049
forget it, it's not going to happen.

221
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:41,354
They pass you over for surgery or duck
behind you when someone's shooting.

222
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,558
You're very, very bitter.

223
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,963
That's exactly what I was thinking!
See? We're meant to be together.

224
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,502
Shut up, Neal.

225
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,901
Mm-hmm.

226
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,436
There are two donors?

227
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,942
Two brothers tried to pass a semi
on a double yellow

228
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,912
and came out on the losing end of a
head-on. Both are a match for your guy.

229
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,417
- So we get our pick.
- It doesn't work like that.

230
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,545
UNOS has already assigned
who gets which donor.

231
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,352
- So who's retrieving the other heart?
- Took you long enough, Preston.

232
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,920
Why is Junior here? Your ego get too big
for one man to carry?

233
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:26,267
Dr. Hahn here graduated second in
our class at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Karev.

234
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,205
Ask her who graduated first.

235
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,139
God.

236
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,472
Kendra's fetus is 12 weeks along.

237
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,879
It seems healthy.

238
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,384
- Did you hear me, Derek?
- I heard you.

239
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,288
You're not going to tell me
what's going on between you two?

240
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,260
- I told you. There's nothing to tell.
- Kendra's parents are here.

241
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:53,695
Let them know the situation,
get the consent forms, then scrub in.

242
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:56,029
- Yes, Dr. Shepherd.
- Thank you.

243
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,737
- What happened to my donor?
- He went into v-fib.

244
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,612
I see. Give me the paddles. Karev,
take over compressions! You gave epi?

245
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:15,119
- Three rounds and shocked him twice.
- I'm going to hit him again at 360.

246
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,117
Clear!

247
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,618
He's asystolic.

248
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,560
I don't get it.
I mean, if the guy's already dead...

249
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,154
And now his heart
has joined the rest of him.

250
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,961
Hmm. So, we can't use it?

251
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:34,631
No, Karev, we cannot use it. The muscle
is dead. The heart is useless.

252
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,738
Dr. Burke?

253
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,304
Move, move, move, move, move!

254
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:49,786
Stop right there! Don't move that
scalpel! Not even a single slice!

255
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:00,189
Just because your donor's heart died
doesn't mean you get mine.

256
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:05,362
Is your patient higher on the transplant
list? Is he higher on the list?

257
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,929
- I have no idea.
- Well, neither do I.

258
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,407
Karev, get UNOS on the phone now.

259
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,967
Oh, give me a break!

260
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,214
- Hey! Hey!
- What? Are you going to beat him up?

261
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,581
- If I have to.
- OK, just hold on.

262
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,485
It's pathetic, Preston. Really pathetic.

263
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,959
I've finished all five of your patients.

264
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,725
Do you mind if I scrub in?
I've never seen an ORIF before.

265
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,562
Can't.
The board's all backed up like crazy.

266
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,262
Will's going to have to wait,

267
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:42,238
because every specialty thinks their
surgeries are more important than Ortho.

268
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,298
Freaking superior macho jerks.

269
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,512
Can I ask you a question?
About bone cancer.

270
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,842
Yeah.

271
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,382
- In a dog.
- A dog?

272
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:56,887
My dog. Well, Derek's dog.
Do you know Dr. Shepherd?

273
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,948
It's our dog. We share the dog,
which is... well, never mind.

274
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,153
I wanted to ask
if you knew the success rate

275
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,026
of curing osteosarcoma
in a canine leg?

276
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:14,002
We have an actual human patient
with a bullet lodged in his tibia

277
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:17,906
who might walk with a limp for the
rest of his life, or even lose his leg,

278
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,570
and you're asking me
about your precious dog

279
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:24,547
that you share with your precious
McDreamy? Yeah, I... I know about him.

280
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,948
And you think I care?

281
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,009
Unbelievable!

282
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,246
Your guy's on an LVAD.

283
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,815
He'll be up and walking around.
My guy still needs his dobutamine drip.

284
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,327
That's the best you can do?

285
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:40,125
He could climb Mount Shasta
on a dobutamine drip.

286
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,998
<i>This morning, Dr. Hahn's patient
was 22 hundreds of a point ahead.</i>

287
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,502
That's basically a tie.

288
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,836
<i>Dr. Hahn's patient was admitted into the
transplant program before Mr. Duquette.</i>

289
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,432
How long before?

290
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,979
<i>17 seconds.</i>

291
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,572
17 seconds.

292
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,743
Might as well be 17 weeks.

293
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,582
- Hello?
- Alex? Where's Dr. Burke?

294
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,096
<i>- What do you want?
- How the heart recovery is going.</i>

295
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,687
He's working on it.

296
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,097
<i>He's working on it?
So, he's operating then?</i>

297
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,328
There were two donors, Izzie.

298
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,997
<i>Our heart flatlined.
He's trying to get the other guy's.</i>

299
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:24,633
- But there's a list.
- And the higher guy gets the heart.

300
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,340
Denny's getting sicker.

301
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,040
What?

302
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,983
Denny's getting worse by the second.
His, uh, sats are in the eighties.

303
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,020
- Izzie.
- It's seventies.

304
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,612
His sats are now in the seventies
and dropping.

305
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,387
- Izzie, I'm not going to lie for you.
- Then put Burke on the phone!

306
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,555
Hey.

307
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,656
- Hey.
- Have you seen Dr. Karev?

308
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,668
Uh... hours ago.

309
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,294
OK.

310
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,904
Sorry. I, uh... I'm not sorry.

311
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:05,075
I just... I'm having a little trouble
because I need to ask you something.

312
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,586
And I don't usually have trouble.
But what I need to ask...

313
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,781
I'm not even sure I want the answer to,
but I have to ask.

314
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:15,451
So I'm just going to ask you
and then you answer and then...

315
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,552
I'll go from there, OK?

316
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,119
OK.

317
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,757
Are you sleeping with my husband?

318
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,996
Not since before I knew he was married.

319
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,496
OK.

320
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:33,638
Except, you know, it just... it felt
like in the vet's office this morning,

321
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,736
and then again in the elevator...

322
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,910
it felt a little like you two
were having a lover's quarrel?

323
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:42,179
No. We're not.

324
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:46,548
I've moved on. I'm dating Finn.

325
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,150
You're dating the vet?

326
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,226
- OK.
- Addison...

327
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,894
No, no. Thanks. I'm... I'm good.

328
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,834
Thanks. I'm great.

329
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,872
<i>Flash pulmonary edema?</i>

330
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,934
<i>Is it the LVAD?
Is the LVAD working?</i>

331
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,377
- Absolutely.
- Did you put him on a nitro drip?

332
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,642
Um, yes. Yes, of course.

333
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,742
Preston, she could be putting paddles
directly on his heart.

334
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,151
<i>- He's not getting it.
- Blood pressure?</i>

335
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,156
It's, uh, still dropping. 82 over 40.

336
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,954
Then take him off the drip
and put him on dopamine. Now!

337
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,823
Don't hang up.

338
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,620
According to my intern,

339
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,634
Denny Duquette now qualifies
as a 1 A candidate for that heart.

340
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,263
- So he's ahead of Dr. Hahn's patient.
- I'm out of here. This is just crap.

341
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,431
<i>- Dr. Hahn?
- What?</i>

342
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,237
<i>If Dr. Burke wants to run labs,
do an echo and a BNP</i>

343
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,278
<i>to fully ascertain the status
of his patient, we'll allow it.</i>

344
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,075
That'll take an hour.

345
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,138
<i>Is the donor stable?</i>

346
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,253
<i>- Dr. Hahn? Is the donor stable?
- Yes, the donor is currently stable.</i>

347
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:54,223
In that case, Dr. Burke,
you've got an hour to get those tests.

348
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,123
- Dr. Stevens?
- I heard.

349
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,355
Good. Get going then.

350
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,708
BP's 220 over 130.

351
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,075
The brain's fungating
out of the wound.

352
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,943
- What's fungating?
- Herniating.

353
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,710
She's bradycardic.

354
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:22,082
Um, give me 50 mannitol and
20 of furosemide. What's her pulse?

355
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:26,647
- Down to 32.
- Come on, Kendra. CO2?

356
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,191
40.

357
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,491
Oh, God. Clot's already
evacuated. All right, everybody.

358
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,395
- But...
- She's brain dead.

359
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,092
There's nothing we can do now.

360
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:42,573
There is no spontaneous brain activity
and she isn't going to wake up.

361
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,301
Oh, God.

362
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,003
What about the baby? Is the baby OK?

363
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,809
As far as we can tell, the baby's fine,
but... that's not the point.

364
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,407
Essentially your daughter is dead.

365
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,749
We need your consent
to remove her from life support.

366
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:01,258
What if we kept Kendra alive?
Could the baby live?

367
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,851
With all due respect, sir,
you don't want to do that.

368
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,556
Are you part of this family?
Do you have a daughter?

369
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,225
If you don't,
you really ought to just shut up!

370
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,292
Our daughter could have this baby?

371
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,972
You know, even with all these cuts,
I don't feel any pain.

372
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,499
I swear, I have the highest
pain threshold of anybody I know.

373
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,072
God! If I could say something
to that guy and not get fired...

374
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,076
He can't fire me.

375
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,984
Uh, Mr. Eckles? Brad?

376
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:34,957
Uh, I'm happy for you
that you're not feeling much pain

377
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,618
from your very minor injuries.

378
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:40,687
But there are a great many people in
this hospital in a great amount of pain.

379
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,826
See, they have bullets in their bones,
in their chests, and in their brains.

380
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:47,393
Bullets from a gun
that was aiming for you.

381
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,498
And although they can't say it
because you are the boss of them,

382
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:54,238
most of these people at this moment
are praying... not that they'll live,

383
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,804
not that the pain will subside,
they're praying to God

384
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,817
for you at this moment
to shut the heck up!

385
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,691
No problem.

386
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:14,863
Karev. He stood there
and chose that moron over me.

387
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,797
I mean, I'm trying to help the dog

388
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,769
and he's standing there
talking about putting the dog down.

389
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,737
Like Doc means nothing.

390
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,138
He's not rewarding Karev,
he's punishing me.

391
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,836
And he hates Finn.
Who, by the way, is great with dogs.

392
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:29,778
He withholds surgery
when I'm a bad girlfriend.

393
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,109
It's his M.O.

394
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:34,515
I mean, how controlling and macho
and petulant is that?

395
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,782
At least he's not shooting people
or putting down dogs.

396
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm dumping him.
This relationship is so over.

397
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,929
- Um, I... I told a lie... to Dr. Burke.
- Good for you. Fight the power.

398
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,196
No, no. I need... um...

399
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,465
God, I can't think. I... I can't...

400
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,474
I don't know what to do. What do I do?

401
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:01,539
There's this guy ahead of Denny
on the transplant list.

402
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:05,810
- He'll get the next heart, Iz.
- No! He needs to get this heart!

403
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,813
He'll probably get a heart
at some point,

404
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:14,016
but as long as Denny's doing well
on the LVAD

405
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,458
and there's someone ahead of him
on the list,

406
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,961
he's not going to get this heart. OK?

407
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,327
Yes. You're right.

408
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:29,567
OK. Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:36,072
If I was going to pick someone who'd
go psycho and shoot up the place...

410
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,673
it's Izzie.

411
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,446
Totally.

412
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,187
- What's all that?
- Heart stuff.

413
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,352
You're putting this heart in me
in my room?

414
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,226
I didn't know transplants
were so informal.

415
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,997
There may not be a heart, Denny.

416
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,594
Somebody at Mercy West
might get it instead.

417
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,735
So this isn't going to happen... again?

418
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,841
Not necessarily.

419
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:16,482
I have been over this and over this and
it can't be a lie and it can't be fake.

420
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,784
We need charts, we need test results.

421
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:22,553
We need UNOS to believe us.
So it has to be real.

422
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,528
What are you talking about, Izzie?

423
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:32,462
In order for you to get the heart, you
would have to get worse. Much worse.

424
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,630
And you would have to do it
very quickly.

425
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:38,300
Well, I don't see that happening.
You see that happening?

426
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,607
I am going to make it happen.

427
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,989
It's been 30 minutes.
Is Stevens answering her page?

428
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,193
She's probably busy
getting test results.

429
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:07,260
- Did you call Bailey?
- Well, she's not answering either.

430
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,475
Check the chart all you want.
You're not getting this heart.

431
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:16,411
Well, you may not want it.
His angiogram shows 30% LAD.

432
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,573
It's still not enough to give it to you.

433
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:25,689
Izzie. Izzie, stop and listen to me.
We're not doing this.

434
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,316
Don't worry. You're not going to die.

435
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:32,123
I'll be here the whole time to make sure
of that and that's what this is for.

436
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:35,097
This isn't about me dying. All right?
This is wrong.

437
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,761
You've waited 18 months to get this.
Who knows when the next one will come?

438
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:41,771
- I'll take my chances.
- No! It may be too late by then.

439
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,672
Then it's too late!
Get this stuff out of here!

440
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,733
Denny, please.

441
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,672
- You have to do this.
- No, Izzie!

442
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:52,545
I'm not about to steal a heart
from another man's chest.

443
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,484
Not to mention, this will be the end
of your medical career.

444
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,647
- I don't care about my medical career.
- All right, you know what?

445
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,089
This has gone on long enough.
I'm calling a nurse.

446
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:05,117
Everyone's entry into the transplant
program is clocked in to the second.

447
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,257
You were clocked in to the second and so
was the other guy. I checked with UNOS.

448
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,699
The difference between
when you entered it

449
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,227
and when he entered it is 17 seconds.

450
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:18,275
That's it, Denny.
Seventeen seconds.

451
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:21,709
I mean, it's not even
the length of a decent kiss.

452
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,644
So this other guy?

453
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,877
I'm not saying that
he doesn't deserve this heart.

454
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:31,149
I'm sure he does. But so do you!

455
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,746
So do you!

456
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:36,725
And if you tell me any more crap
about heading towards the light

457
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:41,060
or looking down on me from heaven,
I swear I will kill you myself.

458
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,633
Izzie.

459
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,899
I'm going to be all right.

460
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,033
All right? You don't have to worry.

461
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,408
What about me?
What about me when you go to the light?

462
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:01,383
- Izzie...
- No! I get it, OK? I get it.

463
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:05,548
You'll be OK.
You'll be fine, but what about me?

464
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,525
So don't do it for yourself.
Do it for me! Please!

465
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,788
Please, Denny! Please do this for me!

466
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:15,093
Because if you die...
Oh, God, you have to do this.

467
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,795
You have to do this for me
or I'll never be able to forgive you!

468
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,203
- For dying?
- No! For making me love you!

469
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:26,869
Please! Please do this for me.

470
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:30,937
OK? Please! OK?
I can't do this if you don't.

471
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:34,951
Please do this for me! Because
if you don't do this... Please!

472
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,885
OK. OK, I'll do it.

473
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:49,462
I'm analyzing an X-ray and your friend
Meredith starts asking me about her dog.

474
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:52,297
Her dog. She wants a medical opinion
about her dog.

475
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,361
She likes her dog.

476
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,707
- Why are you defending Meredith?
- What?

477
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:02,542
I get Izzie. I mean, I don't. But if
you want to defend Izzie, that's fine.

478
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,911
I don't get how you can defend Meredith.

479
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,041
Hey! We're interns.

480
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,610
We all started out together,
Meredith, Izzie, Cristina and me.

481
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,521
George, that woman hurt you
as badly as anyone can be hurt.

482
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,582
You were devastated when I met you.

483
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,650
Hey.

484
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,387
They're family.

485
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:24,161
Izzie and Meredith and Cristina,
they're... they're my family.

486
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:28,331
I can hate Meredith and I can be
angry at her but I'll always defend her.

487
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,966
So you don't have to forgive Meredith,
but I do?

488
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:35,508
If you want a chance
to be part of the family, yeah.

489
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,041
Dr. Burke. Hello.

490
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:41,278
<i>Stevens. Where the hell have you been?
Have you got the lab results?</i>

491
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,980
Um... I'm working on that.

492
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,489
Stevens, I need answers.

493
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,523
<i>- Stevens?
- You should get back here.</i>

494
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,584
<i>With the heart. As soon as you can.</i>

495
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:54,491
What the hell...
What are you talking about?

496
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,795
Preston.

497
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,494
Izzie, what did you do?

498
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:01,868
When I get confirmatory tests and labs
to raise Denny's UNOS status,

499
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:05,340
I will fax them to you. Then you
should waste no time getting back here.

500
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,072
Because I don't know enough to know
how long Denny will have once I start.

501
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:12,582
Start?

502
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,517
<i>What did you do, Izzie?</i>

503
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:20,087
<i>- What did you do?
- I'm going to hang up now. Just hurry.</i>

504
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,204
According to my intern,
Denny Duquette is in pulmonary edema.

505
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,970
He has been intubated
and placed on multiple IV drips.

506
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,842
So, Preston gets the heart.
Great, let's open this guy.

507
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:47,282
However, given this unusual situation
and out of respect to Dr. Hahn,

508
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:50,377
- I'd like to confirm those results.
- You just did.

509
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:54,288
In person.
I want to confirm them in person.

510
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:58,419
Are you kidding? By the time you
get there, it'll be another hour.

511
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,058
What are you up to, Burke?
Why don't you just talk to your chief?

512
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,227
Confirm the results with him.

513
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:13,033
Well, because of the shootings
today... at the restaurant.

514
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,273
- All our attendings are in surgery.
- Exactly.

515
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,510
If you'd prefer, I could call UNOS
and have them give me the heart.

516
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,711
Or I could go and make sure
that it really belongs to me.

517
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,685
Go.

518
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,488
Thank you.

519
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,588
I'm going back to Seattle Grace.
You stay here and protect my heart.

520
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:41,229
If that woman so much as looks at a
scalpel, tackle her. Do you understand?

521
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:42,670
Yes, sir.

522
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,240
- Hey, you got a minute?
- You ready to talk?

523
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:50,780
Uh, my patient, Kendra Thomas.
She's brain dead.

524
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,316
Her parents want to keep her alive
to have the baby.

525
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,181
You want me to talk to the parents?

526
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,881
I tried, but you're neonatal, you might
have a better shot at it than I do.

527
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,947
- OK.
- You can give them a more detailed...

528
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,322
I said I'd do it.

529
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,452
Mr. And Mrs. Thomas.

530
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,429
Dr. Shepherd asked me
to talk to you about your daughter.

531
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,126
We've made up our mind.
She's having the baby.

532
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,362
I know Kendra meant the world to you

533
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:15,269
and I know the terrible grief
you must be going through,

534
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:18,172
but from a medical standpoint,
this is a very bad idea.

535
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:21,234
Well, if we wanted your opinion, miss,
we'd ask for it.

536
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:26,340
It's just... we love our daughter.
Please try to understand.

537
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,612
I do understand. I do.

538
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:32,452
You think if you love her enough
or love her baby enough

539
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,548
that will keep her close to you.

540
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,890
But she's already gone and if you
go with this, you're risking...

541
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,430
I mean, if Kendra
were to contract an infection,

542
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:43,057
she could pass it on
and it could cause brain damage...

543
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,657
We're taking our chances.

544
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:49,263
Now they keep organ donors alive
after they're... gone.

545
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,103
Why not Kendra?

546
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:55,009
Organ donors aren't kept alive for
six months. Your daughter is brain dead.

547
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,877
She can't regulate body temperature,
hormone output.

548
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,348
These things are very important
for a fetus.

549
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,909
- You can regulate that stuff, right?
- We could try. I...

550
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,422
Then try, damn it!
What the hell's the problem here?

551
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,857
The problem is you want to use
your daughter's corpse as an incubator.

552
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,725
- That's the problem!
- OK, I'm sorry. Would you excuse us?

553
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,764
- What?
- They just lost their daughter.

554
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,733
I know. They need to face that.
She's not coming back.

555
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,895
A little sensitivity
would be nice here, OK?

556
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,701
They love their daughter.
They don't want to let go.

557
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:28,040
What they're doing is not about love.
It's... It's... Well, it's like you.

558
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,342
- Excuse me?
- Like how you pretend to love me,

559
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:33,110
but you're just using me
to fill your need to be a good guy.

560
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:35,378
Now is not the time to talk about this.

561
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:37,920
- You walk away? That's all I get?
- Just calm down.

562
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,081
You're not going to yell at me?
Call me names?

563
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,489
Or I don't know...
ignore me in an elevator?

564
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,619
- What do you want from me, Addison?
- I want you to care!

565
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:48,256
I sleep with your best friend
and you walk away.

566
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:50,960
He comes out here from New York
and rubs it in your face,

567
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:55,563
and still you get a good night's sleep.
What do I have to do? Oh! I know.

568
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:58,472
Maybe what I should do
is go out on a date with the vet.

569
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,443
Because that seems
to send you into a blind rage.

570
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:06,176
Oh, but wait. That won't work either
because I'm not Meredith Grey!

571
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:37,310
I know it's a bad time, but do you
still want to go ahead with the baby?

572
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,585
We haven't decided on anything.

573
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,948
Sir? You asked me before
if I had a daughter.

574
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:53,690
I don't. But I have a family.
I... actually have a couple families.

575
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:58,224
The thing about families, you don't
necessarily like what they do.

576
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,670
Their choices and their decisions.
But you stick by them.

577
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,801
Right now one of my friends,
her boyfriend is dying.

578
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:11,143
Heart failure. He's 36. Kendra's
driver's license says she's a donor.

579
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,979
She's not a match,
but she could save a dozen other lives.

580
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:17,145
And from what I know about Kendra,
what I've heard,

581
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,248
I got to believe that if she had the
choice between where she is right now

582
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:25,523
and saving a dozen other people,
she'd save those people.

583
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,496
That would be her decision.

584
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:33,594
So the question is...
whether you stick by her one last time.

585
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:39,602
Excuse me.

586
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,009
You paged?

587
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:53,284
Yeah. These are X-rays of a human
with an osteosarcoma on his tibia.

588
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,851
It's the closest I could get to
mirroring what's happening to your dog.

589
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:01,091
In this patient,
the cancer was aggressive.

590
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,898
And it spread quickly and he died when
it finally metastasized on his lungs.

591
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:08,563
- The human died?
- Yes. The human died.

592
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,501
Thank you, Callie.

593
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,740
You're welcome, Meredith.

594
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,843
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah.

595
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:27,923
Well. You made up with him?

596
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:32,121
- I said I'd give him one more chance.
- And I said she won't have to.

597
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,360
What I went through today, what we went
through today, it's changed me.

598
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:40,927
This bullet will always remind me
to do the right thing by my Deborah.

599
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,403
Here you go.

600
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,135
And whatever's going on
with you and your boyfriend?

601
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,609
Maybe you should just
try and forgive him.

602
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,170
It really feels so much better
than all that anger.

603
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,806
Thanks.

604
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,757
We haven't forgotten you, Will.

605
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,225
We'll get you to the OR
as soon as possible.

606
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,761
My friend, Kendra...

607
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,495
Dr. Grey said that if anybody
had any information

608
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:15,470
that they would let me know
as soon as possible.

609
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,273
OK. I'm sorry.

610
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:38,060
I'm going to get you some time off, man.

611
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:42,690
I'm going to talk to the owner,
make sure they keep your job for you.

612
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:46,167
It's not your fault you got shot.
Not my fault either.

613
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:48,761
You know, I... I didn't...
I didn't pull the trigger.

614
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,501
Petey had the gun. I'm just saying.

615
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:55,443
People blame management,
but we do the best we can.

616
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:58,743
I mean, I... I do the best I can.

617
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,788
I know what you're going to say,
but if you knew the day that I had...

618
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,589
Everybody in this hospital
has those days, Addison.

619
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:15,758
And no one makes a scene in front
of their peers. Get it together.

620
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,132
Addison.

621
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,371
I can't compete.

622
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:26,671
He's not having an affair.
He's not trying to hurt me. He's just...

623
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:31,544
The only people who don't know Derek
loves Meredith are Derek and Meredith.

624
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,344
How do I compete with that?

625
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:42,754
<i>So what makes anger different
from the six other deadly sins?</i>

626
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:16,284
<i>It's pretty simple really.</i>

627
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,093
<i>You give in to a sin like envy or pride
then you only hurt yourself.</i>

628
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,101
I love you.

629
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,072
I'm sorry. I'm...

630
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,302
I... I didn't mean to... I just...

631
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:38,371
I... I have verbal diarrhea
and I'm a moron.

632
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:42,811
What are you thinking?
Are you freaking out or?

633
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:47,619
George, I need your help. I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important. It's...

634
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:50,216
OK.

635
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,426
I'll call you? Later?

636
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,158
Sure.

637
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,762
Were we supposed to have dinner tonight?

638
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,176
- Tell me the truth about Doc.
- What about him?

639
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,475
You've been downplaying how sick he is,
haven't you?

640
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:16,076
The best-case scenario,
I would say Doc has maybe a year left.

641
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,419
- OK.
- And Doc is not the best-case scenario.

642
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,623
- OK.
- Meredith?

643
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,559
Oh, damn it.

644
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:33,168
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.
I know how much you love him.

645
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:35,431
I do.

646
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,871
I love him so much.

647
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,309
- You need my help for an EKG?
- No. Come.

648
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:50,786
OK, after I do this,
I might have to shock you a few times.

649
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,846
- Do what?
- You feeling good?

650
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,722
I think so. Explain this to me again.

651
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:01,127
The LVAD has been inserted into your
abdomen and is connected to your heart.

652
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,790
This leads to the power source,

653
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,892
this one is connected to the pump
that pumps your heart for you.

654
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:10,372
I have the crash cart, the
defibrillator, the Ambu bag, saline...

655
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,771
Do what, Izzie?

656
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,175
Um, I feel like we should say stuff.

657
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,338
Denny, do you want to say stuff?

658
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,474
Kiss me. Right here.

659
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:30,987
Izzie, that kiss was worth
1,000 words.

660
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,894
A picture.
A picture is worth 1,000 words.

661
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,865
- You're correcting me now?
- I don't mean to be intrusive...

662
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:39,731
Just give me a second, George!

663
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:42,636
OK, are you ready?

664
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,469
As I'll ever be.

665
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,905
Wait. What are you doing?

666
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,747
<i>Try lust or coveting
and you'll only hurt yourself,</i>

667
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:57,048
<i>and probably one or two others.</i>

668
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:01,254
<i>But anger... Anger is the worst.</i>

669
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,626
- OK. We're done!
- What was that? Were those gunshots?

670
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,100
<i>The mother of all sins.</i>

671
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,197
Petey.

672
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,970
Denny. If there really is
some kind of big glowy light...

673
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,477
- I'll try like hell to stay out of it.
- Exactly.

674
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,380
- I don't like the sound of this.
- Just make sure nobody comes in.

675
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,486
What are you doing?

676
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:36,817
I'm stopping his heart, George.

677
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,555
<i>Not only can anger
drive you over the edge,</i>

678
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:44,623
<i>when it does, you can take
an awful lot of other people with you.</i>

679
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,237
Izzie.

680
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:59,581
Oh! Dr. Burke. I need some help!

681
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:10,926
It's OK.
Burke will be here any minute.
