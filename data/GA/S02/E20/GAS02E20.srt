00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,866
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,494
I did a terrible thing.

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,972
- Sleeping with me is this awful?
- No, George!

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,531
I grew my hair for her.

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,133
I could be your friend.

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,443
- Why do you think she cheated on you?
- I was just a little absent.

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,483
Give me a call when you're in town.

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,677
I thought we had plans.

9
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,449
Not how I envisioned our first date.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,320
Can we please just go back
to everything the way it was?

11
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,555
- I don't live here anymore.
- Your friend needed our help.

12
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,994
- Good night.
- Good night.

13
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,998
Good night.

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,798
<i> As doctors,</i>

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,404
<i>patients are always telling us</i>
<i>how they would do ourjobs.</i>

16
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,852
<i>"Just stitch me up,</i>
<i>slap a Band-Aid on it and send me home. "</i>

17
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,258
<i>It's easy to suggest a quick solution</i>

18
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,590
<i>when you don't know much</i>
<i>about the problem,</i>

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,392
<i>when you don't understand</i>
<i>the underlying cause,</i>

20
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,593
<i>orjust how deep</i>
<i>the wound really is.</i>

21
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,329
So, your friends,

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,497
are they still mad about
this bad, horrible thing you did?

23
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,064
The very horrible bad thing
I won't tell you?

24
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,168
- Yes, they are.
- Whatever it is, I don't want to know.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,509
Even if I beg, don't tell me.

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,913
- OK. I won't.
- Good.

27
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,917
OK. Although we are friends.

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,385
- True.
- Technically, you tell friends stuff.

29
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,253
You come to me with a problem,
I give you the answer.

30
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,816
After, maybe we celebrate
the moments of our lives.

31
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,455
I will keep that in mind
next time I do a horrible thing.

32
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,227
Don't you have any problems
you want to tell me about?

33
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,361
Truthfully? This moment in time,
I don't have any problems.

34
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,362
Not a single one.

35
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,039
<i>The first step toward a real cure</i>

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,081
<i>is to know exactly</i>
<i>what the disease is to begin with.</i>

37
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,979
<i>That's not what people want to hear.</i>

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,039
Morning.

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,550
- How many miles was that, Dr. Burke?
- Five.

40
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,920
Five. Five miles in 50 minutes.

41
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,425
- Nice.
- We can get it closer to 45.

42
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,462
- Pancakes?
- Uh, top cupboard.

43
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,937
- What's wrong with your hair?
- Leave the man alone.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
He's got issues.

45
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,676
And if he wants to cut his hair
to get over those issues,

46
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,646
that's his business, his thing.

47
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,740
It's my thing. Coffee?

48
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,748
Oh, cappuccino.

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,344
Ooh, excellent. Cappuccino.

50
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,384
<i>We're supposed to forget the past</i>
<i>that landed us here,</i>

51
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,758
<i>ignore the future complications</i>
<i>that might arise,</i>

52
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,296
<i>and go for the quick fix.</i>

53
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,027
- Is George having a nervous breakdown?
- Burke says he's got issues.

54
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,198
You should see them, like, doing things.

55
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,210
Like running and... cooking and talking.
They're like bonding.

56
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,214
And you're afraid Burke will realize
he makes a better girlfriend than you?

57
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,375
You know,
just go and apologize to him.

58
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,712
- I've tried.
- Try again.

59
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,413
Things can't stay like this.
They suck like this.

60
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,985
What's with O'Malley's hair?
He looks like a hobbit.

61
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,550
- He's just trying a new look.
- You didn't call back. You avoiding me?

62
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,028
Why would I be avoiding you?

63
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,655
Denny Duquette, aged 36.

64
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,064
37 in three weeks.

65
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,367
37 in three weeks. Has difficulty
breathing and chest pains.

66
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,270
- Breath sounds?
- A little junky.

67
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,172
He has a build-up of fluid.

68
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,235
Did you just call me a junky?
That's not very nice.

69
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:37,716
Denny, your congestive heart failure
is getting worse despite the meds.

70
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,319
All right. So how do we proceed?

71
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,321
Doctors, how do we proceed?

72
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,880
Titrate up his nitrate drip,
then diuretics.

73
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,019
ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers
and start dobutamine.

74
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,062
I want his ins and outs recorded and
one of you monitoring him at all times.

75
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,828
- I'll stay.
- Me, too.

76
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,944
Mr. and Mrs. Gibson,
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

77
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,809
I'll be covering for Dr. Pollack.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,579
Mrs. Gibson had a preterm, premature
rupture of her membranes at 28 weeks.

79
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,281
She's confined to bed rest for
seven weeks and has a low-grade fever.

80
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,948
Can't you just schedule a C?

81
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,117
Believe me, I am ready
to have this baby.

82
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,455
You and me both.

83
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,985
I want to get your blood work
before we make any further decisions.

84
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,624
I have to pee. Again.

85
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,259
Come on. Here we go.

86
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,604
I appreciate you
taking over my wife's case.

87
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,834
- Dr. Pollack says you're the best.
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Gibson.

88
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,573
He didn't mention that...

89
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,607
I mean, you bear a striking resemblance
to a young Catherine Deneuve.

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,653
Oh, you never heard that before?

91
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,882
Eh, no. I'm sorry.

92
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,393
- I have to say, it's a first.
- Been told I look like Halle Berry.

93
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,055
Beautiful.
Beautiful. Well, Ms. Deneuve.

94
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,726
Of course, you are, too,
but by extension.

95
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,194
Right. We'll be back in later
to check on your wife.

96
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,235
Look forward to it.

97
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,741
- ER needs a consult.
- O'Malley, Grey, you go take that.

98
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,409
- What about Mrs. Gibson?
- I'll take care of her.

99
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,181
- Uh, do they really need both of us?
- I guess you'll find out. Go.

100
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:27,249
- Are you taking him to the nursery?
- It's full and Tucker's out of town.

101
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,161
- You brought your baby to work?
- Uh, yes, Chief.

102
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,198
You're not taking him into surgery.

103
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,996
- I don't have anything scheduled.
- Yet.

104
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,629
I can't solve a problem
until there's one to solve.

105
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,163
- Are you saying there's a problem?
- Is there a problem, Richard?

106
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,099
No.

107
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,214
You know, at some point
you are going to have to talk to me.

108
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,547
I'm going to take the stairs.

109
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,729
- You paged?
- Just got a new patient.

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,392
Looks surgical, maybe neuro.

111
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,472
Doesn't look neuro to me.

112
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,671
- Not him.
- Oh no, I'm fine. It's my wife.

113
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,012
This is so embarrassing,
but we didn't know what else to do.

114
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,034
We were at the Hotel Monaco
having brunch. We had some mimosas.

115
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,537
Can we skip that part?

116
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,837
Can we pull this out and just go?
I'm fine, really.

117
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,070
Sylvia was giving me
some special attention.

118
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,704
- Under the table.
- Dear Lord.

119
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,770
Oh! OK.

120
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,442
Sweetie, they're doctors.
They've heard it all.

121
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,214
- Absolutely.
- While I was down there

122
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,256
it was like a shock
went through my body.

123
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,349
- And she... clenched.
- Clenched?

124
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,023
- My jaw. It just shut.
- Oh, and I panicked.

125
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,158
I grabbed the fork off the table
and it was just instinctual.

126
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,963
It doesn't hurt that much.

127
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,971
We just didn't want to pull it out.
It's in pretty good.

128
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,566
No, you did the right thing.
Pulling it out could cause more damage.

129
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,702
I want to do an X-ray
to make sure no nerve

130
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,269
or major blood vessels
are being compromised.

131
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,110
Did you get your injury checked?

132
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,481
Doctor says I'm fine.
It's just bruising.

133
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,986
I want to find out
what caused the clenching.

134
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,751
- Do you have a history of seizures?
- No, nothing like that.

135
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,920
It may... It may have something
to do with her brain aneurysm.

136
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,863
- Kyle. I don't want to do this now.
- It's not on there.

137
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,764
Can we just take this fork out and go?

138
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,927
No.

139
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,904
- She was diagnosed six weeks ago.
- Your doctor didn't recommend surgery?

140
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,203
All the surgeons say it's inoperable.

141
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,470
That's why Kyle and I
are here in Seattle.

142
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,102
The Space Needle.

143
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,810
- I've always wanted to see it.
- We wanted to see it together.

144
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,685
Do an MRI.

145
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,121
It's good to see you.

146
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,682
- What do we got?
- Tachycardic in the 140s.

147
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,820
Systolic dipped to the 60s.
Last was 72 over 40.

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,091
- Can you turn that off? Turn it off!
- OK.

149
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,932
Dr. Bailey?

150
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,205
- Here. Take him.
- Uh, what?

151
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,674
- Watch him.
- No, you don't want to do that.

152
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,267
Yang, I have a patient.

153
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,609
I need to operate
on that patient right now.

154
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,205
- We could page the chief.
- I'm not paging anyone.

155
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,774
I'm going to do the surgery.
Cris, I...

156
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,385
I need you to help me, Cristina.

157
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,787
I... I...

158
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,188
OK.

159
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,853
You watch from the gallery.
You both can.

160
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,079
- Hey.
- Hey.

161
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,917
- You didn't call me.
- I did, I did.

162
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,457
A few times.
I just hung up every time.

163
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,757
Nice, very stalker-like.

164
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,923
Goes with the hair.

165
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,103
I thought it would look good shorter.

166
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,229
It is shorter.

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,902
- I make you nervous, don't I?
- A little.

168
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,536
- That's good.
- That's no... What?

169
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,240
Hey, are you busy?

170
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,807
No.

171
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,615
Want to see something really cool?

172
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,315
Whoa.

173
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,186
Excellent, right?

174
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,056
- It is. How did you do that?
- After hockey practice.

175
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,927
I didn't have my glove on.
I was drinking from the goalie's bottle.

176
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,331
This asshat crashes into the net,
my hand gets tangled in the mesh

177
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,598
and I start hearing pops, big pops.

178
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,730
Dr. O'Malley, what do you see?

179
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,039
Ooh, dislocation of the PIP joint,
multiple fractures.

180
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,239
- That must really hurt.
- It's just a finger.

181
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,215
Last season I took a puck to the face,
broke two teeth.

182
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,717
Oh.

183
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,549
Orthos love hockey season.
It's Christmas every day.

184
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,285
Can we just put it in a splint?
I got a really big game this afternoon.

185
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,288
Um... do you know what you're doing?

186
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,391
I mean, have you ever done this before?

187
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,627
Have I ever pulled a fork out of a neck?

188
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,672
Hmm. Right.

189
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,607
OK. Let's just do it.

190
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,007
- Honey.
- Huh?

191
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:50,105
- Talk to me. Distract me.
- OK. Think about Paris, huh?

192
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,343
- And the food and the wine.
- Uh-huh.

193
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,854
And the long walks we'll take together.
And the Champs EI... What?

194
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,151
- The Champs Élysées.
- The Champs Élysées.

195
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,988
- Yeah.
- More food, more wine.

196
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,823
- OK.
- That's it?

197
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,920
Oh, my God,
I didn't even feel anything.

198
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,698
You're amazing. She's amazing.

199
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,465
So... how much do you know
about this Dr. Shepherd?

200
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,233
- Kyle, no.
- What?

201
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:18,174
I do not want another MRI.
I want to go to Paris.

202
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,179
I made a few calls.
He has an incredible reputation.

203
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,513
Please, Kyle.
Let's just live our lives.

204
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,543
I want to go crazy.
I want to crawl underneath the table.

205
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,420
I want to go to Paris
while we still can.

206
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,517
Dr. Shepherd
is an extraordinary surgeon.

207
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:39,121
If he thinks he can help, a
second opinion couldn't hurt, could it?

208
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,634
It won't be a second opinion.
It'll be a fourth opinion.

209
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,035
And when Dr. Shepherd says
there's nothing more he can do,

210
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,074
we'll be devastated all over again.

211
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,601
I just want to spend
what little time we have left in Paris.

212
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,672
So do I. But I don't want to go to Paris
and wonder if we should have listened

213
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,878
to the amazing girl
who took the fork out of your neck.

214
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,593
- You're not Izzie.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

215
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,066
Not disappointed. Just saying.

216
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,836
- Where is she?
- Oh, she's busy with other patients.

217
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,434
I'm afraid you'll have
to make do with me.

218
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,572
Look, man, I'm sure you're...

219
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,583
I'm sure you're a fine doctor.
You're just...

220
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,211
You're just not as much my type.
No offense.

221
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,690
I'll just have to settle
on being Izzie's type.

222
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,852
So you...?

223
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,088
- You two...?
- Yeah, yeah.

224
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,360
Pretty much. You know.

225
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,701
Congratulations.

226
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,799
~ <i>A, B, C, D...</i>

227
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,968
Oh, gross.

228
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,477
~ <i>E, F, G</i>

229
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,277
~ <i>This really couldn't suck any worse...</i>

230
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,477
Dr. Yang?

231
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,613
- Oh, uh, Dr. Webber.
- What's that smell?

232
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,285
Uh, it's feces. It's baby feces.
We've had an incident, sir.

233
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,795
Are you having trouble
with the diaper, Yang?

234
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,491
- It looks like you're having trouble.
- No, sir.

235
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,764
I've got an MD from... Stanford
and a PhD from Berkeley.

236
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,806
I can handle this diaper.
Unless you want to.

237
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,733
Uh... no.

238
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,109
It's all right, it's all right.

239
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,375
You carry on.

240
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,472
Carry on.

241
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,016
- Can we stop for a moment, please?
- Sure.

242
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,117
I can walk.

243
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,357
- OK. The wheelchair is just protocol.
- Yeah, well...

244
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,888
I'm way past caring about protocol.

245
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,366
I just want to feel
my body move while I can.

246
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,929
You seem incredibly OK
with your prognosis.

247
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,510
I'm more than OK.
I'm a little in love with my prognosis.

248
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,207
It woke me up.
It woke my marriage up.

249
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:14,742
I've been sleepwalking about 15 years.
And now... I am wide awake.

250
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,924
I'm having this MRI for Kyle.
He's not ready to let go.

251
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,127
But me and my aneurysm?
We're good friends.

252
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,468
- Hey, I've been looking for you.
- Hey. Look.

253
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,336
- Look at the size of this aneurysm.
- Oh, it's big.

254
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,467
- Are you going to operate?
- I'm definitely intrigued.

255
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,241
- Do you know who Catherine Deneuve is?
- Um...

256
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,283
Yeah. Actress. French. Hot.

257
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,548
One of my patients, her husband,
said I looked like her.

258
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,980
Isn't she blond?

259
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,293
Yeah, I... guess. I don't know.

260
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,454
I don't know.

261
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,723
Anyways, uh...

262
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,426
- OK, you're busy.
- Bye.

263
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,539
I'm not just
another pretty face, you know.

264
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,168
- Got it going on up here as well.
- So you keep telling me.

265
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,941
Yep. I probably know...
hundreds of words.

266
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,950
Really? Hundreds?
Wow, you're a real brain trust.

267
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,485
Ouch.

268
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,747
Well, I'm highly competitive.

269
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,448
Screw.

270
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:28,186
S-C-R-E-W.

271
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,252
- That's 25 points. Thank you very much.
- Wait a second now.

272
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,857
You didn't tell me we were playing
naughty word Scrabble.

273
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,961
- We're not. You just have a dirty mind.
- Oh, it's filthy.

274
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,029
You're the one that put down "screw".

275
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,475
- I was referring to hardware, not sex.
- Oh.

276
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,813
I guess maybe sometimes it's, uh...

277
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,612
hard to tell where you're...
coming from.

278
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,288
What do you mean?

279
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,921
Alex, uh...

280
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,160
He may have said something
about you guys...

281
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,131
um, being together.

282
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,733
Well...

283
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,669
he had no business telling you that.

284
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,606
And besides,
it's not even true, so...

285
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,905
So you're not together?

286
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,947
No. I mean...

287
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,982
Yeah, a little, but...

288
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,574
Not really. So...

289
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,641
No.

290
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,416
OK, well, sweet. Thanks, uh...

291
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,318
Thanks for clearing that up.

292
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,441
Denny, what is it? Don't panic.
Just try to breathe.

293
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,841
Page Dr. Burke!

294
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,503
Just try to breathe.

295
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,640
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Take it easy.

296
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,159
He had flash pulmonary edema.

297
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,788
I switched him to nesiritide,
started milrinone and put him on BiPAP.

298
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,765
- That's a good call, Stevens.
- Good call.

299
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,959
- Bad news, right?
- It's not good.

300
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,701
The fact is, Denny, you need a new heart
and you're running out of time.

301
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,211
So... what's behind door number two?

302
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,714
I would like to install
a left ventricular assist device.

303
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,274
It's a battery operated machine
to help your heart pump.

304
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,580
Battery operated?

305
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:39,488
I knew it. You people
are trying to turn me into a robot.

306
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,052
It's all part of your evil plan
to take over the hospital.

307
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,529
It's a bridge to transplant, Denny.

308
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,864
It'll keep you alive
while we wait for your new heart.

309
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,097
That easy, huh?

310
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,104
- No catch?
- There are some risks.

311
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,509
Increased damage to your platelets
and increased bleeding.

312
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,241
If you do choose the assist device,

313
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,182
you may not leave hospital
until you get a donor heart.

314
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,218
Any other options?

315
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,197
I'm going to need time to think.

316
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,795
Don't take too long, Denny.

317
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,709
- Always happy to get this page.
- That's not why I paged you.

318
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,614
Oh, what you paged me
to the on-call room to talk?

319
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,744
No, I paged you
to the on-call room to yell.

320
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,448
Why the hell
did you talk to Denny about us?

321
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,048
Oh, you never talk to Denny
about personal stuff?

322
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,754
Not about our sex life, Alex!
That is between us.

323
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,228
So none of your friends know
we sleep together?

324
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,458
Are you saying
you and Denny are friends?

325
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,001
- I'm not friends with patients.
- You're an ass.

326
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,937
You feel threatened by him.
That is why you did that.

327
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,443
You're his doctor and he's your
half-dead, soon to be all-dead, patient.

328
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,173
How could I possibly be threatened
by that guy?

329
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,643
I can't believe you just said that.

330
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,275
Someone's got to.

331
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,621
I'll schedule the surgery for your son.
In the meantime,

332
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,824
I'm sending Heath home
with a prescription for hydrocodone

333
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,458
to control the pain.

334
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,366
I get that this is a bad break,

335
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,667
but it doesn't hurt much.
I'm telling you, I can handle this.

336
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,641
Here's what I'm thinking:
we put a splint on my finger

337
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,701
so I can jam it into the glove,
play today and I'm all yours.

338
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,715
- You are not playing today!
- Heath, your mom is right.

339
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,946
Thank you.
Did you hear that? I'm right.

340
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,512
- Your mother must be proud.
- Scouts are coming, college scouts.

341
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,558
I could get a scholarship today!

342
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,117
If I cut that bandage off
we risk permanent damage to your finger.

343
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,090
I'm with you, but I'm sorry.

344
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,398
There's no way we can put your finger
into a glove today.

345
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,928
There must be something you can do.
I need to play this afternoon.

346
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,033
This game is what
I've been training for my entire life.

347
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,943
This is my chance to go to college,
it's my whole future.

348
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,039
Honey, you can go
to community college.

349
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,411
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,219
- Ooh. That sucks.
- Yeah.

351
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,388
Oh, Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

352
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,729
- Are those my wife's test results?
- Yes, they are actually.

353
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,496
There's no infection.

354
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,901
I'm scheduling a C-section
this afternoon.

355
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,907
I was actually going to go up
after lunch and tell her.

356
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,875
- Mr. Gibson...
- You do look like Catherine Deneuve.

357
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,347
I'm talking to you about your wife...

358
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,350
- giving birth to your baby.
- I know.

359
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,181
I'm sorry. May I?

360
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,156
Listen, I don't mean
to focus on your looks.

361
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,852
You seem very kind, intelligent.
You're a doctor.

362
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,626
I don't mean to objectify
or harass you in any way.

363
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,962
I'm usually not this awkward, but...

364
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,299
you're just
so extraordinarily beautiful.

365
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,738
I understand if a woman like you
doesn't want to eat with me.

366
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,968
So, uh... Well, anyway.

367
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,032
No, no.

368
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,111
- Really?
- Yes, stay. It's fine.

369
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,877
All right.

370
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,749
You going to eat that pudding?

371
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,883
- Take him.
- Bailey gave him to you.

372
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,222
She's only in surgery
for another half hour, hour tops.

373
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,888
- Take him.
- You're a liar and you smell of vomit.

374
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,557
Really? Because I think
she smells like poo.

375
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,328
This is why some species
eat their young.

376
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,532
- Have you talked to Meredith yet?
- Tomorrow I am going to buy a T-shirt

377
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,097
that says,
"Stop asking me about Meredith".

378
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,269
I'm going to wear it every day
until people stop asking me.

379
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,508
At least they won't be asking you
about your hair.

380
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,779
Oh, come on. Meredith, stop him.

381
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,253
What should I do? Knock him down?

382
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,292
Do you know he cut his hair
over my bathroom sink today?

383
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,624
George is a good roommate.
You can tell him what's annoying you.

384
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,496
No, he's not my room... This is why
I shouldn't have given up my place.

385
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,763
He would still be our roommate
if Meredith would apologize.

386
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,033
I have apologized.
I've apologized sincerely.

387
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,698
And you know what?

388
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,767
It takes two to make
a stupid sexual decision. So, whatever.

389
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,369
Oh!

390
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,472
Oh, I just miss when we all got along.

391
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,643
- Can't we just go back to that?
- Well...

392
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,345
Excuse me.
I have to check on a patient.

393
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,490
Awesome. Awesome.

394
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,793
Thanks, Alex. Thank you. Oh, yeah.

395
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,698
OK. Shut it.

396
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,292
Shut it. Shut it.

397
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,361
They have no right to be mad at me.

398
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,497
- It's none of their business.
- I agree.

399
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,134
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

400
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,735
You're mad at your friends
for being mad at you.

401
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,871
I hate them. I do.

402
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,278
What the hell did you do?

403
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,819
I'm not telling you.

404
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,720
You know, as a friend, you suck.

405
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,094
Does Addison know we're friends?

406
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,735
Did you get Sylvia Booker's
blood work back yet?

407
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,671
I'm going right now.

408
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,425
- <i>Dr. Bailey?</i>
- What is it, Yang?

409
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,691
<i>Uh... he's crying.</i>

410
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,631
Let me hear him.

411
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,931
- <i>What?</i>
- Let me hear the baby cry.

412
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,462
Um...

413
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,640
That's cry number four.
You need to feed him.

414
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,481
Oh, God! Oh...

415
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,288
- A double-barrel what?
- It's a double-barrel brain bypass.

416
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,489
I'm going to use two scalp arteries
to redirect the blood flow in your brain

417
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,997
around the aneurysm.

418
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,161
- How come no one else mentioned this?
- This surgery is rarely performed.

419
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,727
I have performed one
and I've watched one.

420
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,035
But I don't want
to understate the risks.

421
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,405
- Risks?
- The risks are that the aneurysm

422
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,742
- could rupture on the table.
- But there's a chance it could work?

423
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,280
No.

424
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,815
Hell, no.

425
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,648
I'm leaving
and we're going to Europe.

426
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,655
We've always wanted to see it,
we've never had the time.

427
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:56,183
This is the time.
We're going. That's it.

428
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,827
- Dr. Shepherd? Can I get a word?
- Yes.

429
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:12,174
- I'm sorry if my wife offended you.
- Oh, no. No offense at all.

430
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,975
Um... I didn't notice her.

431
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:20,609
- I'm sorry? I...
- For 15 years, I didn't notice her.

432
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,483
When we got married,
she was everything.

433
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:27,548
Somewhere along the way, I stopped
noticing her, stopped seeing her.

434
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,686
And since she's been sick,
she's all I see.

435
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,061
And I hate that that's what it took.
I hate it and I'm sorry.

436
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,123
But I love her.

437
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,862
And I don't want her to...

438
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,070
I don't want my wife to die.

439
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,009
Please talk to her.
Dr. Shepherd, please.

440
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,477
OK.

441
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,321
I had a lunch date
with my patient's husband today.

442
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,919
He paid attention to me, Miranda.
For a whole half hour.

443
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,161
Addison, you're not going
to fix the problems with your husband

444
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,725
by having meals with someone else's.

445
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,370
I mean it.

446
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,844
Oh, please eat. Eat!
I'm begging you to eat.

447
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,709
It's yummy food. Yummy.

448
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,909
Bailey, breast... milk.

449
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,509
- Food, come on!
- Well, look at you.

450
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,288
- You find this amusing?
- You don't?

451
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,559
You know what? I can't help you.

452
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,721
I cannot help you
if you don't want to eat.

453
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,697
If you're going to keep on crying...

454
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,426
Then eat.

455
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,041
O'Malley, you're a natural.
You have nieces and nephews?

456
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,875
- Babies just like me.
- It speaks to a good bedside manner.

457
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,676
- Keep it up.
- Thank you, sir.

458
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:03,618
Hey, is that Bailey's baby?
Oh, he is so cute.

459
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,280
Hi there.

460
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,893
I scheduled the Mercer kid's surgery
for tomorrow. Do you want in?

461
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,624
Oh, no, I want in, on any surgery.

462
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,893
- I'll do it.
- Who are you?

463
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,837
I'm Cristina.

464
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,603
- Sorry. I only need one.
- Oh. Well, absolutely. I'm in.

465
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,976
Oh, and George? This is
the last invitation I'm extending.

466
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,481
So... the ball's in your court.

467
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,478
- OK.
- OK.

468
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

469
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,253
Nice. Think she has
a couch you can sleep on?

470
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,787
Mrs. Booker.

471
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,629
I'm waiting for my husband.
He's bringing the car.

472
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,269
Mrs. Booker...

473
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,838
I know you're worried
about the surgery.

474
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,640
No I'm not. I'm not worried about it
because I'm not having it.

475
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,112
You're not having the surgery
because of the medical risks?

476
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,845
No, I'm not having it because...

477
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:13,080
because for the first time in 12 years,
I have a great marriage and a life.

478
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,853
And I want to live it.

479
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,655
You have weeks.

480
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,086
If this surgery is successful,

481
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,292
you're looking at decades.

482
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,562
I don't think you understand.

483
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,799
I'm not crazy and I don't want to die.

484
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:34,238
I don't want to go back to being Kyle's
bed warmer in a flannel nightgown.

485
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,645
- Can you understand?
- I understand you're tired of settling.

486
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,878
So don't.

487
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,975
Fight.

488
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,510
Fight for your life,
fight for your marriage.

489
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,184
Let me operate.

490
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,523
And make a decision right now
that you'll never settle again.

491
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,871
The LVAD will inhibit
organ deterioration,

492
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,108
allow you to get off the meds you're on

493
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,343
and give your heart
a much-needed rest.

494
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,782
Izzie.

495
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,519
I'm just...

496
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,823
I'm so tired.

497
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,632
I appreciate that.

498
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,364
But the LVAD also has
increased survival rates

499
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,407
over conventional therapies
and I think that you need...

500
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,339
Hey.

501
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,642
Having this surgery...

502
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,313
it means I don't get to leave here.

503
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,679
And you know
how much I hate hospitals.

504
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,896
I do know.

505
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,491
But as your doctor, I can't
support you making any other decision.

506
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,628
This surgery will allow you more time
and we need more time.

507
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:10,863
We?

508
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,445
We, your doctors...

509
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,105
need more time.

510
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,348
And we need more time.

511
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,191
So... you'll be here?

512
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,252
Every day.

513
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,304
And as an added bonus,
it'll really piss off Alex.

514
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,305
Yes, that it will.

515
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,035
OK.

516
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,004
OK?

517
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,209
OK.

518
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,520
OK. OK.

519
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,563
- Heath.
- I told you I couldn't miss my game.

520
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,337
I made two goals and one assist
and there were scouts!

521
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,344
- What did you do?
- I cut off my finger.

522
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,383
It's OK. I saved it
so you guys can sew it back on.

523
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,420
There's deep tissue infection here.
Not good.

524
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,092
He said he found out
how to do it on the Internet.

525
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,965
Who puts up Web pages
on how to cut off your own finger?

526
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,666
He's got a passion and he sacrificed
for it. You got to respect that.

527
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,203
No... you don't.

528
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,804
Thank you, Bokie.
He cut off his finger.

529
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,313
A finger... Sorry.

530
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,850
...that would have healed
in a few months.

531
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,887
Sometimes you can't wait.
You just want the pain to stop.

532
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,882
So you cut it off.
End the problem. End the pain.

533
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,689
That doesn't... end the pain.

534
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,094
I mean, if it's that painful...

535
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,758
to start with,
then even if you cut it off,

536
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,360
there's always going
to be that... phantom pain.

537
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,738
Your ex did a real number on you, huh?

538
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,712
- You're quitting your job?
- Absolutely.

539
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,579
And we're selling the house?

540
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,746
And we're moving to Paris
and we're spending that nest egg now?

541
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,982
- Promise?
- I promise.

542
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,649
- And, baby?
- Yeah?

543
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,587
If I die...

544
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,794
promise me you'll do it anyway.

545
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,423
I promise.

546
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,434
I'm sorry.
This is as far as you can go.

547
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,140
Sylvia, please don't die.

548
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,977
I'll do my best.

549
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,133
I fed him.
Oh, God, there's poop everywhere.

550
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,058
Wait.

551
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,003
- Go back to sleep, Cristina.
- Oh, good.

552
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,804
I know you're the boss of me
and you could destroy my career

553
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,176
and make my life a living hell
and torture and all of that.

554
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,078
But, just in the future...

555
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,443
I don't baby-sit.

556
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,377
Fine.

557
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,530
I read that a patient's heart
can remodel itself

558
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,499
and they can be
weaned off the LVAD.

559
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,832
It's not likely in Denny's case.
His heart is too weak.

560
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,621
I just wanted to make sure
everybody was doing OK.

561
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,255
Everything's fine.
Thank you so much.

562
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,364
Oh, yeah, right... Thank you.

563
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:43,875
When you put your freshly severed finger
into a grungy, bacteria-filled glove,

564
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,042
- you got a severe infection.
- What?

565
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,349
No, the Internet didn't say
anything about infection.

566
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,585
We didn't realize how deep the infection
had gone until we were in there.

567
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,787
- There was too much tissue damage.
- The infection was caused

568
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,262
by a methicillin-resistant
staph bacteria.

569
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,630
It's spreading. We'll be lucky
if we can preserve enough muscle

570
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,566
for you to have any hand function.

571
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,797
What does she mean?

572
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,399
You may never regain
complete control of your hand.

573
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,240
No. That's wrong.

574
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,940
You're wrong.

575
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,313
Ronnie Lott played for the 49ers
when he cut off his finger.

576
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,876
He could still play.
I got the directions off the Internet.

577
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,150
- My poor baby.
- Mom, stop, they're lying!

578
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,782
They're trying to scare me.

579
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,089
I'm sorry. I really am, but...

580
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,389
your hockey career is over.

581
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,322
Mom.

582
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,836
Mom, they're wrong, right?

583
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,895
- They have to be wrong.
- Sweetheart.

584
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,771
I got the directions off the Internet.

585
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,972
Is there any evidence
of vasospasm or bleeding?

586
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,574
- No, it looks good.
- So do you think they'll move to Paris?

587
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,312
I hope so.

588
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,796
That was amazing.

589
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,664
It was, wasn't it?

590
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,459
Yeah.

591
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,364
Meredith...

592
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,002
You know I was kidding this morning?

593
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,277
I mean, you can tell me
about this horrible thing.

594
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,648
Come on, you can talk to me.

595
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,983
As a friend?

596
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,320
As a friend.

597
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,693
There's a line
between friends and "not" friends.

598
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
And if I tell you this...

599
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,507
If I tell you this horrible thing,
you have to react as my friend,

600
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,805
not my "not" friend.

601
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,868
I can do that.

602
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:59,909
All right, you tell me what's wrong,
I'll tell you how to fix it.

603
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,354
- OK. You're ready?
- I'm ready.

604
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,589
I slept with George.

605
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,971
And... it was a horrible mistake.

606
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,009
And now everything has changed.

607
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,045
And I don't know how to repair it.

608
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,775
I don't even know where to start,
but I just know that I have to. And...

609
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,085
Say something friendly.

610
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,020
You tell him that.

611
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,931
You find George and you apologize.

612
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,561
That's what everyone says,
but he won't listen.

613
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,571
Make him listen. You tell him.

614
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,200
Just tell him again and again
and again until he listens.

615
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,039
How do I do that?

616
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,737
You do what I do.

617
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,950
Use the elevator.

618
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,059
You're trapped.

619
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,231
And you don't have to talk.

620
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,207
I'll do the talking.

621
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,166
George,

622
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:39,911
I am truly, very deeply sorry.

623
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,747
And I'm not going to make excuses.

624
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,980
I'm just sorry.

625
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,919
Look, I know you're going to get
off this elevator and not look back.

626
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,693
I know that, but, George,
we're friends, real friends.

627
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,233
That means,
no matter how long it takes,

628
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,328
when you finally do decide to look back,
I'll still be here.

629
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,209
<i> As doctors, as friends,</i>
<i>as human beings,</i>

630
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,046
<i>we all try to do the best we can.</i>

631
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:31,992
Hey.

632
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,232
- Don't you have somewhere to be?
- Yeah.

633
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,837
Yeah, I'm there.

634
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,911
<i>But the world is full</i>
<i>of unexpected twists and turns.</i>

635
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,718
<i>And just when you've gotten</i>
<i>the lay of the land,</i>

636
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,557
<i>the ground underneath you shifts</i>

637
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,329
<i>and knocks you off your feet.</i>

638
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,776
<i>If you're lucky, you end up</i>
<i>with nothing more than a flesh wound,</i>

639
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,413
<i>something a Band-Aid will cover.</i>

640
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,022
- Hi.
- Hey.

641
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,739
<i>But some wounds are deeper</i>
<i>than they first appear</i>

642
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,572
<i>and require more than just a quick fix.</i>

643
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,276
What?

644
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,381
I was indifferent.

645
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,651
You know,
in New York before Mark.

646
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,656
I was just indifferent towards you.

647
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,025
Yes.

648
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,868
I was absent.

649
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,802
Yes.

650
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,777
I'm partly to blame
for what's happened to our marriage.

651
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,012
Yeah.

652
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,425
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,132
I'm working on it.

654
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,430
OK.

655
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,312
<i>With some wounds,</i>

656
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,941
<i>you have to rip off the Band-Aid,</i>

657
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,678
<i>let them breathe</i>

658
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,483
<i>and give them time... to heal.</i>
