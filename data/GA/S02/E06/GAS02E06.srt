00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,333
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,303
What is going on with you?

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,364
We grant you four months
to retake the medical board exam.

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,774
- Karev, take the scalpel.
- Alex, come on.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,440
Your choice. It's simple. Her or me.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,315
Addison is my family. I'm supposed to
sign a piece of paper and end my family?

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,853
- Your date?
- My husband.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,854
- You're married?
- Ten years today.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,617
Burke wants a relationship.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,352
OK. We're a couple.

11
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,556
So pick me. Choose me.
Love me.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,159
I'll be at Joe's tonight. If you decide
to sign the papers, meet me there.

13
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,033
Tell me what to do.

14
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:51,174
I actually said "Pick me."
Right? I did? "Pick me"?

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,880
- I think it's romantic.
- It's not romantic, it's horrifying.

16
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:59,391
Horror movie horrifying. Carrie at the
prom with the pig's blood horrifying.

17
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,983
OK, fine, it's horrifying.

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,157
But Carrie took out
an entire senior class as revenge.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,165
Gotta say, I like that in a girl.

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,929
I said "Pick me."

21
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,903
When you say "I'll meet you later"

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,201
how long does that mean
you should wait?

23
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,210
- Do you think he's really not coming?
- It is getting a little hard to watch.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,838
It was hard to watch an hour ago.
Now it's pathetic.

25
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,083
Who's pathetic?

26
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,681
- What?
- You, who pretend to be my friends,

27
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:33,192
are calling me pathetic
behind my back in front of my face.

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,423
Why don't you just dump the pig's blood
on me now and get it over with?

29
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,064
He's really not coming.

30
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,701
Joe, turn up the TV.

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,145
<i> A massive train wreck occurred</i>
<i>just outside Seattle minutes ago.</i>

32
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,410
- 911.
- We just worked a 30-hour shift.

33
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,419
I don't have any clean underwear.

34
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,456
<i>The Vancouver-bound train</i>
<i>was carrying 300 passengers.</i>

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,515
- Looks ugly.
- <i>Paramedics are helping victims.</i>

36
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,754
You're leaving?
No, you can't leave.

37
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,558
Sorry, gotta go tend
to someone else's train wreck.

38
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,122
You gotta at least stay
for a cup of coffee.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,601
You're in no shape to cut people open.
I want to hear the ending.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,194
Meredith?

41
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,934
Maybe it's for the best.
Maybe I don't want to know.

42
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,704
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

43
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,245
- <i> In general...</i>
- Bye, Joe.

44
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,873
<i>... people can be categorized</i>
<i>in one of two ways.</i>

45
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,940
He was in the front of the train.

46
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:37,581
<i>Those who love surprises,</i>
<i>and those who don't.</i>

47
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,421
<i>I don't.</i>

48
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,865
Dude, you're late.

49
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,706
<i> Once again, a massive train wreck</i>
<i>occurred outside of Seattle minutes ago.</i>

50
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,837
<i> I've never met a surgeon</i>
<i>that enjoys a surprise,</i>

51
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,281
<i>because, as surgeons,</i>
<i>we like to be in the know.</i>

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,045
<i>We have to be in the know.</i>

53
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,816
<i>Because when we aren't,</i>
<i>people die and lawsuits happen.</i>

54
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,915
<i>Am I rambling? I think I'm rambling.</i>

55
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,786
I think I saw a pneumothorax.
I hope I get a pneumothorax.

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,060
- Hey.
- Thought you weren't talking to me.

57
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,625
Thought you needed a friend,
so I'm rising above.

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,399
- Why would you think that?
- Because you freaked out.

59
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,872
- I did not.
- Missed out on open-heart surgery.

60
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,877
- O'Malley plugged the hole.
- I thought you needed to talk.

61
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,573
- Well, I don't.
- To someone who cares about you.

62
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,447
- What are you looking at?
- Is that a dress?

63
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,421
Nothing. What?

64
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,219
Go get me my damn shoes.

65
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,283
Let's move, people.

66
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:54,759
Hello. I seem to be a little bit drunk.
I was off duty.

67
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,234
So was I.
Anybody else half in the bottle?

68
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,066
- No.
- All right then.

69
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,504
Stay out of the way.
I'll deal with you later.

70
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,134
The rest, stick with me
and wait for assignments.

71
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,644
I know you get all a-quiver
at the sight of blood,

72
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,205
but it'll be a long night and you're
tired. I want no mistakes. Come on.

73
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,875
I'm done. Done.

74
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,222
- I'm so not tired anymore.
- Me neither.

75
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,398
I've got a third-trimester burn victim
here. I'll need some help.

76
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,625
- Izzie, go.
- Yes. Have a nice nap.

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,066
- Have you had any contractions?
- No.

78
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,740
Hey. Joe told me to tell you that
McSteamy came looking for you.

79
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,407
You mean McDreamy?
Joe said McDreamy came looking for me?

80
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:48,182
No, I'm pretty sure it was McSteamy.
Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,726
Dr. Shepherd,
could you take a look at this?

82
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,490
Does that mean he picked her?

83
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,195
If it does, I just lost 50 bucks.

84
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,099
Got the leg!

85
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,175
- I want that leg.
- He lost a lot of blood at the scene.

86
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,236
Pressure dressings applied,
two large-bore IVs started.

87
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,977
- Anything for pain?
- Morphine. Five migs given so far.

88
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,042
Dr. Bailey, who you got?

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
- Cristina, go.
- Yes!

90
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,089
Rule out other injuries and book an OR.

91
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,627
- Dr. Webber?
- We have a train wreck, Derek.

92
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,858
We need all hands on deck.
Clear me for surgery or you're fired.

93
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,364
- Any headaches today?
- No.

94
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,834
- Dizziness? Nausea? Blurred vision?
- No, no and no. Out of my way.

95
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,600
Fine. But I'm coming with you.
Or I'm fired. Up to you.

96
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,703
<i>If you're a resident, page the operator.</i>

97
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,508
- Was that a nod?
- Yes.

98
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,210
- Do we know what it meant?
- No.

99
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,021
Am I invisible?

100
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,321
<i> OK, so my point actually,</i>
<i>and I do have one,</i>

101
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:06,093
<i>has nothing to do with surprises</i>
<i>or death or lawsuits or even surgeons.</i>

102
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:10,966
<i>My point is this: whoever said,</i>
<i>"What you don't know can't hurt you"</i>

103
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,198
<i>was a complete and total moron.</i>

104
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,570
<i>Because for most people I know,</i>

105
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,838
<i>not knowing</i>
<i>is the worst feeling in the world.</i>

106
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,387
<i>OK, fine, maybe it's the second worst.</i>

107
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,259
His BP's steady at ninety over palp.

108
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,272
She's had two hypotensive episodes
to the low seventies.

109
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,831
- Couldn't get a saw in?
- Not without moving them.

110
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,538
- Which would've been a bad idea.
- Did you bolus her with fluids?

111
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,478
We're pushing it open...

112
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,880
Is this the craziest thing you've seen?

113
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,211
Uh... Yeah.

114
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,054
Yeah. Me too.

115
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,463
OK, then. You guys got it from here.

116
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,132
Hey, uh... You were at the scene?

117
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:23,403
Yeah. Won't be too bad for you.
Lot of carnage. Not a lot of survivors.

118
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,378
They're never gonna fit into CT.
We're gonna be flying blind.

119
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,506
Get X-rays and labs, then page me.

120
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,844
Excuse me?

121
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,908
Hi, I'm Dr. Burke.

122
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,883
You shouldn't turn your head. You want
to try to move as little as possible.

123
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,686
Oh. OK.

124
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,718
So are you gonna pull this pole
out of us anytime soon?

125
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,354
Touch uncomfortable.

126
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:49,527
Sorry, we can't until we get a better
look at what's going on internally.

127
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,093
I assure you we will work
as quickly as possible.

128
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,702
Well, in that case,
does anybody have a breath mint?

129
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,905
For me, not for you.

130
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,116
- Keep them going.
- O'Malley? Get them to X-ray.

131
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,588
- Thanks.
- Move them extremely carefully.

132
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,594
This never would've happened
before the elevator.

133
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,653
You go, George.

134
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,062
Alex, cover the ER.

135
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,264
You can do sutures while you get over
your newfound fear of scalpels.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,432
That was mean, even for you.

137
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,506
You are drunk.

138
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,071
Go get yourself a banana bag IV,
put it in your arm and then find me.

139
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,846
Do not speak to any more patients,
do not practice any medicine.

140
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,854
Well, should I just go home?

141
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,449
Unless you drank the whole bottle,
you'll be sober in a few hours.

142
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,017
And the IV fluids
will head off your hangover.

143
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,792
Then you can assist
with the many mangled victims here.

144
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,629
Besides, if I'm not going home,
nobody's going home.

145
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,797
Ten years of marriage. I didn't even
get to finish my damn lobster.

146
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,037
Well, is there anyone
you'd like me to call?

147
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,134
They called my wife from the ambulance.

148
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,669
And my fiancé. They're flying down
from Vancouver together.

149
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,946
Normally, Amanda would be upset to find
me pressed up against another woman.

150
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,419
But in this case,
I think I'll get a pass.

151
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,787
- You two weren't traveling together?
- No. We just met.

152
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,419
- Bit of an awkward introduction.
- You have very nice pores.

153
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:26,226
Hurts to laugh.

154
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,893
- Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,596
- Whoa. You can go ahead and just...
- Oh, thanks.

156
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,397
Oh, wow.

157
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,601
- Do you think I could...
- Yeah, go ahead.

158
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,823
Dr. Stevens, did you need something?

159
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,381
No.

160
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,563
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Am I doing this too...

161
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,590
- Ow! Was that a... Did I have...
- A contraction.

162
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,501
It was definitely a contraction.
We need to book an OR.

163
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,870
You are in no shape to push,
and the baby is still in some distress,

164
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,637
so we're gonna have to proceed
with a C-section.

165
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,674
OK. OK.

166
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,342
But can we call a lawyer first?

167
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,947
I don't have a will.
And there's no father.

168
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,917
And in case something happens to me...

169
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,656
There's no cause for panic, Brooke.
We have some time, OK?

170
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,891
OK.

171
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,263
Hello.

172
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,393
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine, honey.

173
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,631
Some redneck tried to outrun the train.

174
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,435
The train slammed into his ass
and then it rolled...

175
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,941
- That hurt?
- Uh-uh.

176
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,274
Oh, no, no, that dude is toast.

177
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,404
Him and about 200 other people.

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,575
- And Mary got her face all cut up.
- Does it hurt anywhere else?

179
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,050
Here.

180
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:57,488
A whole bunch of luggage, when they hit
the brakes, it just came flying at us.

181
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,549
We'll do an X-ray, see if anything's
broken, or if there's internal injuries.

182
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,094
OK.

183
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,790
Yeah. Wait. Hold on.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

184
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:10,700
- Hey. Excuse me. Where you going?
- I'm taking your friend for an X-ray.

185
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,706
No offense, little boy,
but you look like my oldest son,

186
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,675
- and he's nothing but trouble.
- Yvonne, shut up.

187
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,803
I said "no offense."
I'm just saying, sure you're a doctor?

188
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,818
Yeah? Yeah, we're fine.

189
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,514
Yeah, this redneck
tried to outrun the train...

190
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,617
Ow! Ow. Ow.

191
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,929
- What are you doing?
- Trying to insert my banana bag.

192
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,160
Which sounds vaguely dirty,
but it isn't.

193
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,060
I can do it.

194
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,128
So, how's it going with Addison?

195
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,969
Bad mood? Good mood?
"Yay, my husband picked me" mood?

196
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,948
I think it's more of an "I hate
the smell of charred flesh" mood.

197
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,052
Before you judge me,
I know there was a train accident.

198
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,215
People are very badly hurt.

199
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,022
And that I'm a vapid narcissist
when you mix me with alcohol.

200
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,393
In case you were wondering, I know that.

201
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,657
Well, for what it's worth, I take issue
with her salmon-colored scrubs.

202
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,570
I mean, what self-respecting surgeon
wears salmon-colored scrubs?

203
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,368
- This is what I'm saying.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,713
Thank you.

205
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,375
Yang, how's that wound looking?

206
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,010
Pretty clean. Some dirt and gravel.

207
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,384
He was lucky. It's a guillotine injury.

208
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,753
We do this right,
he'll have full use of his leg.

209
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,418
More irrigation.

210
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,984
Dr. Shepherd?

211
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,597
It'll wait.

212
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,568
I'm fine, Derek.
Just adjusting to the light.

213
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,900
There's no shame
in taking more time off.

214
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,668
It doesn't make you old
or tired or rusty, it...

215
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,733
OK, that came out wrong.

216
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,839
You're the only attending neurosurgeon,
you're needed elsewhere. I'm fine here.

217
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,907
Dr. Shepherd?

218
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,385
OK. Page me if you need me.

219
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,554
When you're finished cleaning
that wound, you can help me, Dr. Yang.

220
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,990
Is the wound clean, Yang?

221
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,795
- Yes, sir, I... But...
- But what?

222
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,700
If your plan is to be a watchdog
for Dr. Shepherd

223
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,401
or if you think your job here is to
baby-sit me, then you can think again.

224
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,274
I've been a surgeon
longer than you've been breathing.

225
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,281
If I were not ready to be in this OR,
I would say so. Is that understood?

226
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,943
- Yes, sir.
- Now do we have a problem, Yang?

227
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,318
Yes. No, sir.

228
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,256
I'm thrilled to learn.
And I'm grateful to be here.

229
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,726
It's just that...

230
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,921
Um...

231
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,328
Sorry. His legs...

232
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,094
What about them?

233
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,263
They're both left.

234
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,202
- Find the man's leg, Yang. Find it now.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,214
Is it going straight through her spine?

236
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,682
It is. T8's completely crushed.

237
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,677
Hey.

238
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,154
What happened?

239
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,522
Uh, tequila.

240
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,322
I'm keeping an eye on her.

241
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,595
Look at this.
These people are still alive?

242
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,601
They're still making small talk.

243
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,968
Pole's tamponading the wounds
as far as we can see.

244
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,768
It's hitting the aorta.

245
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,368
And look at him. It's right in line
with his inferior vena cava.

246
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,642
Is there any way to operate
without separating them?

247
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,649
- No.
- But if we move the pole then...

248
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,776
They'll both bleed out.

249
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,845
What if we don't move the pole?

250
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,227
What if we move one of the patients
off the pole to get the saw in there?

251
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,162
Then we can hold the pole steady
in the other one.

252
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,394
Move it very slowly,
and repair the damage as we go.

253
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,494
Who? Which would you move?

254
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,433
With her aortic injuries,

255
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,136
her chances of survival
are extremely slim no matter what we do.

256
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:17,148
But if we move her,
we have a real shot at saving him.

257
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,209
Well, I could argue since her injuries
are more extensive, we should move him.

258
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,517
Give her the best shot we can.

259
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:29,093
So basically whoever you move
doesn't stand a chance?

260
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,957
So how do you choose?
How do you decide who gets to live?

261
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,472
We have to decide soon
if we want to save one of them.

262
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,708
- I'd like to examine them first.
- I'll wait for your page.

263
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,113
Thank you. Dr. Grey?

264
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,882
Dr. Grey needs to get a blood alcohol
test before practicing medicine tonight.

265
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,654
What? No, I'm totally fine, look.
Totally fine.

266
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,861
Right. OK.

267
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,761
- I'm fine.
- Regretting that last shot about now?

268
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,436
What are you doing in here?

269
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,702
The leg you brought with the amputee...

270
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,872
- I didn't bring in an amputee.
- OK, well, one of you did and it's...

271
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,313
'Cause all paramedics look alike to you?

272
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,820
OK. Really. I cannot straddle
another giant ego right now.

273
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,947
I'm already doing the splits.
I need a right leg, right now,

274
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,323
or the Chief of Surgery
will take away my pretty blue scrubs.

275
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,658
When the train derailed,
it hit an overpass.

276
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,166
The dining car roof sheared off
and sliced through a passenger car.

277
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:45,897
There were multiple decapitations.
Your guy can live without his leg.

278
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,440
This is so not about the leg.
Or the guy.

279
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,242
But thank you. For all that you do.
Really. Thanks.

280
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,984
Yeah, honey, we're fine.

281
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,820
Some redneck tried to outrun the train,
then they give us this boy doctor.

282
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,088
All right, scar shouldn't be too bad.

283
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:14,394
Can you tell me...
My friend... She's pregnant too.

284
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:20,302
She went in a different ambulance. She
was burned. Do you know where she is?

285
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,000
If she's not here,
she should be in Maternity.

286
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,305
I need to see her.

287
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,869
- We're not finished here.
- My baby's fine. I feel her kicking.

288
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,472
- I've got to see Brooke.
- You can't just leave.

289
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,575
Just wait. Come here, come here.

290
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,917
Ow! Ow!

291
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,013
Sorry.

292
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,685
So you operated on a heart earlier.
You'd think you could draw blood.

293
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,057
- I rocked that heart.
- Yeah, you did.

294
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,162
I think I'm strung out on the scalpel.

295
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,160
Nothing wrong with that.

296
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,404
So any news? About...

297
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,704
No. I can't read him.

298
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,578
I think it's pretty amazing
you even gave him the choice.

299
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,484
And I think, for what it's worth,

300
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,250
I think he's crazy
if he doesn't pick you.

301
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,293
Please tell me you've seen a right leg,
a cleanly severed right leg.

302
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,658
No.

303
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,422
How weird is this job?

304
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,391
Weird.

305
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,668
- Brooke?
- Jana?

306
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,240
- Thank God.
- Dr. Karev?

307
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,746
- I couldn't stop her.
- She was on the train?

308
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,907
- Yes, but...
- Have you done an ultrasound?

309
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,746
Cleared her C-spine?

310
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,549
Is there a reason why she is wandering
around the hospital unattended?

311
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,750
She's not unattended.
I came up with her. She's...

312
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,817
You can leave now, Dr. Karev.

313
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,260
Irresponsible even for an intern.

314
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,427
What? You disagree?

315
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,703
She wanted to see her friend. I mean,
what was he supposed to do, tackle her?

316
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,735
Dr. Stevens, why don't you get
our new patient into a bed? Shall we?

317
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,276
Can you feel that, Miss Krasnoff?

318
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:19,290
You're a cute doctor. Cute doctors
get to call me by my first name.

319
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,652
- Bonnie?
- Mmm.

320
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,425
OK, Bonnie. Can you feel that, Bonnie?

321
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,162
Can I feel what?
Oh. Well, I guess that's a no.

322
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,794
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

323
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,534
- I got the labs.
- Great, thank you.

324
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,467
Here you go. Hold that, please.

325
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,447
Could you try to wiggle your toes,
Mr. Maynard?

326
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,507
- Are they moving?
- Yes, they are.

327
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,146
- Good. That's good, right?
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

328
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,747
What about me? Are mine moving?

329
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,987
Yes, they are.

330
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,496
Yay me.

331
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,301
- Dr. Shepherd, is it?
- Yes, it is.

332
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,998
Dr. Shepherd, Bonnie and I...

333
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,300
- are we going to live through this?
- Now that's just morose, Tom.

334
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,278
I'm sorry, dear.

335
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,343
Doctor?

336
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,313
We're going to do everything we can,
Mr. Maynard.

337
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,993
About time. I was starting to
think my work here would be wasted.

338
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,625
So sorry. It wasn't easy to find.

339
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,296
I checked the wound
and it's very clean cut, well preserved.

340
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,032
Dr. Webber?

341
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,470
Sir?

342
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,145
Notice anything else about that leg?
Anything other than that very clean cut?

343
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,486
Did you happen to notice, for example,
that it was shaved recently?

344
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,995
And manicured?
Take a look at my patient, Dr. Yang.

345
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:09,193
Does he look like a man who woke up
and shaved one of his legs this morning?

346
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,826
No.

347
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,032
I'll go find the right...
the right right leg.

348
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,574
- The right...
- Thank you.

349
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,411
- Where are we?
- You were right. Vitals are erratic.

350
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,615
Pulse is weak. The spine's severed.
I was hoping that it didn't hit.

351
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,817
But from that angle,
it just can't have missed the aorta.

352
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,383
What about him? Think he can live?

353
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,487
- He's got better odds.
- Let OR One know we're coming.

354
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,538
And, O'Malley, close off the gallery.
We don't need an audience for this.

355
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,141
She's cracking jokes.

356
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,544
How do you tell someone she'll be dead
soon when she's cracking jokes?

357
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,254
Excuse me? Is there any chance that we
can get out of here some time this year?

358
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,692
Well, the lab's backed up
and so is Radiology.

359
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,197
I can't discharge her until I know
she has no internal injuries.

360
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,595
Hello? Yeah, we're still here,

361
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,004
'cause the doctor's friggin' useless.
Mm-hm.

362
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,067
I realize you're dealing
with a lot of carnage.

363
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:30,638
I'm asking if you could maybe
sift through some of that carnage

364
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,550
and find a...
Hello... Dammit.

365
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,610
Cristina. You paged me?

366
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,283
If I don't find this leg, the chief
is gonna cut me from this program.

367
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,760
And I cannot go back home, Burke.
It is too sunny in Los Angeles.

368
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,820
It's sunny every day.

369
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,493
And you paged me because?

370
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,626
I need you to help me find the leg.

371
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,762
I checked the board.
You're not in surgery, right?

372
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,599
You're my boyfriend. I mean...

373
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,647
I know I don't have much experience
with this kind of thing,

374
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,047
but aren't boyfriends supposed to help
in situations like this?

375
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,952
Cristina, when we're on duty,
I can't be your boyfriend.

376
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:15,560
OK, so when we're on duty,
I can have sex with someone else?

377
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,730
Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now.

378
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,065
Fine. Fine. But when the chief cuts me,
you might rethink this.

379
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,866
Addison yelled at you
in front of a patient?

380
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,840
She didn't exactly yell.

381
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,471
- Fine, she's Satan's whore.
- Thank you. So did you yell back?

382
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,746
- No.
- Dude, you lost your mojo.

383
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,788
- Excuse you?
- I was trying to talk boy.

384
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,915
O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger
and he's a hero.

385
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,358
- I have one off day...
- You chickened out.

386
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,453
I hesitated briefly.

387
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,521
Why didn't you kiss Izzie?

388
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,998
- And now I'm leaving.
- It's not in the morgue.

389
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,365
I've looked in the ambulances,
in the ER...

390
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,873
How is one bloody, hairy leg
going to destroy my career?

391
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,632
Dr. Karev?

392
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,341
I hope you find your mojo, Alex.
I find you disturbing without it.

393
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,883
Me too.

394
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,475
Ow!

395
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:22,551
This is hard, because your body
is in a certain amount of shock.

396
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:27,655
It's preventing you from feeling pain,
feeling the extent of your injuries.

397
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,700
Dr. Shepherd.

398
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,899
We have a metal pole
cutting a path through our insides.

399
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,898
I don't know about Tom here,

400
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,345
but I didn't expect
to walk out of here anytime soon, so...

401
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,680
whatever it is you have to say,
just please, say it.

402
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,883
OK, Bonnie.

403
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,826
In order to operate on Mr. Maynard,
we have to separate you two.

404
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:01,323
In order to do that, we have to
move you backwards off the pole.

405
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,432
Can't you just pull the pole
out of both of us?

406
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:10,999
If we did that, you would both start
bleeding very quickly. Too quickly.

407
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,476
Right now the pole
is plugging the wounds.

408
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,605
Once removed, the organs will shift.

409
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,974
And there is a great deal of damage.

410
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,757
So, if you move me, I'll die?

411
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,091
We're gonna do everything we can to...

412
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,033
No. No. If anybody has to go,
it should be me.

413
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,231
- You just move me...
- No, Mr. Maynard.

414
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,933
Mr. Maynard.

415
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,643
Your injuries are less extensive.

416
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,079
If we pull the pole from you
as we operate around it,

417
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,710
we have a better chance
of repairing the damage.

418
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,448
It's not right.

419
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,024
It's not fair.

420
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,029
Tom.

421
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,964
It's not fair either way.

422
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:17,932
Is um... Is my Danny... Is he here yet?

423
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,739
There are delays at the airport.
The storm...

424
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,939
We could wait.

425
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,781
But the longer we do,
the higher the risk of infection for...

426
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,717
No. No.

427
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,779
This is better.

428
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,088
Danny, he wouldn't understand.

429
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:41,492
I've had a couple of hours
to, you know, process all of this,

430
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:46,026
but if... if he had to see me,
talk to me like this...

431
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,507
Well, I just think it would be too hard.

432
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,897
Right there.
In between the vertebral spaces.

433
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,956
Don't be shy about pressure.

434
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,060
That's good. You are doing so good.

435
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,901
- Somebody called for a notary?
- I asked for a lawyer.

436
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,032
I couldn't get one
at this time of night.

437
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,543
But the hospital has
pretty standard forms.

438
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,876
It says that in the case of death
or permanent vegetative state,

439
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,974
your child remains in the custody of...
We put her name in.

440
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,316
Wait. What?
What are we... Who's dying here?

441
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,846
There's some danger.
With any surgery, there's danger.

442
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,826
But with the trauma of Brooke's burns,
there's an additional risk of shock.

443
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,295
- She wants to be certain.
- That's ridiculous.

444
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,355
You're going to be fine, do you hear me?

445
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,493
I hear you.
But we still have to sign the forms

446
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,129
unless you want our son
to end up with my mom.

447
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,277
How long have you two been together?

448
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,371
Since third grade.

449
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:09,246
We're not lovers, we're best friends.
We wanted our kids to have two parents.

450
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,949
- So we got a sperm donor...
- The same donor?

451
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,219
So your babies are brother and sister?

452
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,954
How cool is that?

453
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,723
That's... Wow.

454
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,230
- Wet.
- What?

455
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,692
I'm wet. I think my water just broke.

456
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,066
Good news. You've got a broken rib,
we're gonna give you some painkillers.

457
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,373
- After that you should be good to go.
- Thank you.

458
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,311
Yvonne, answer your phone.

459
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,545
Yvonne? Yvonne?

460
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,079
Yvonne!

461
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,383
- Code blue! I need some help here!
- Yvonne!

462
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,555
Push one of epi. Hold CPR.

463
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,427
Her abdomen is rock solid.
She's lost too much blood.

464
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,161
- She's been bleeding for hours.
- There's no blood.

465
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,261
- She was bleeding internally.
- She didn't say anything.

466
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,239
She was... She wasn't even a patient.

467
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,832
I didn't know.

468
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,172
Dr. Karev, she's gone.

469
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,147
No! No!

470
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,843
No! No! Yvonne!

471
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,410
I'm sorry.

472
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,981
Time of death, 2:51.

473
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,754
No, no, no, no.

474
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:27,628
Don't. Try again. Try again.

475
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,502
Jana, this is our OB resident,
Dr. Hoffman.

476
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,700
She's gonna be taking care of you
from here.

477
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,765
Uh-huh.

478
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,038
You're doing great, Jana,
keep breathing.

479
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,103
I'm gonna check your cervix now.

480
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,649
We've booked an OR
but they won't hold it for long

481
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,117
- so we need to go now.
- Right now?

482
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,212
But we're supposed to be together.
We took classes.

483
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,349
- I'm sorry, but we can't wait.
- That's OK, Brookie.

484
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,054
You go have your C-section.
And enjoy those drugs.

485
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,098
- This is already not fun for my vagina.
- Dr. Stevens?

486
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,965
- No. If I have to go, she has to stay.
- Someone has to stay with Jana. Please.

487
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,939
Brooke, Dr. Stevens is a surgeon,
but I'm gonna...

488
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,408
It's OK. I'll stay.

489
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,842
OK.

490
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,280
Brookie. Stay alive, OK?

491
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,046
You too.

492
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,690
Dammit!

493
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,394
- Hey, Doc.
- What?!

494
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,199
Easy, killer. Jill said you guys were
freaking out looking for this leg.

495
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,269
- Thank you.
- No problem.

496
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,409
Right on.

497
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,549
Chief Webber, I'm extremely sorry, I...

498
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,587
Pull that tendon down
with those pick-ups.

499
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,782
- You found the leg?
- I found the leg.

500
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,954
You missed out on this, but
I'm sure they could use a hand in ER.

501
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,122
Karev and I can handle it from here.

502
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,431
Suction.

503
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,078
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hm.

504
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,480
Do you believe in heaven?

505
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,584
I do.

506
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,082
Don't you?

507
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,862
I want to.

508
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,527
Bonnie...

509
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,131
I just want to say...

510
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,699
Shhh!

511
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:58,907
I know. I know.

512
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,425
This is Dr. Adams,
our anesthesiologist.

513
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:15,364
When you're ready,
he's going to put you to sleep.

514
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,091
So it's not gonna hurt?

515
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,262
It won't hurt a bit.

516
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,636
Good.

517
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,698
That's good.

518
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,705
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes?

519
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,377
You're gonna be the one
to talk to my Danny, right?

520
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,743
Yes.

521
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,984
- OK.
- OK.

522
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,027
What would you like me to tell him?

523
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,700
Why do I feel like
we're about to kill this girl?

524
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,764
Dr. Bailey, my labs are in.

525
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,742
- Sober?
- Can I scrub in?

526
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,244
Do it fast.

527
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,790
- George.
- Right.

528
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,169
Hey.

529
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,399
Hi.

530
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,281
- You know, I went to the bar.
- I heard.

531
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,429
You take some aspirin with the
banana bag? Helps with the hangover.

532
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,868
Oh.

533
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,615
You're staying with her.

534
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,084
Yeah, she's my wife.

535
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:31,363
Dr. Shepherd, she's crashing.

536
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,639
What happened?

537
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,698
- I just put them under.
- The pole must've shifted.

538
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,801
I barely touched her.
This isn't my fault.

539
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,438
It's nobody's fault.
We need to remove her now.

540
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,449
- How do we do this?
- Team One, stabilize his body.

541
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,213
Team Two, move her back
and let's get the saw in there.

542
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,448
This has to be fast and smooth, people.

543
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,683
O'Malley, you hold the pole in place.

544
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,124
- Whatever you do, don't let it move.
- OK.

545
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,821
On the count of three. One, two...

546
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,826
Three!

547
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:07,064
That's great. That's great.
Take another breath. One, two...

548
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,198
He's wedged under her ribs,
we have to pull him out.

549
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,504
On three. One, two...

550
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:24,411
- Watch her head.
- Clean towel.

551
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,554
- He's stable.
- Retract.

552
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,566
Let's start with her
and see what we can do.

553
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,898
- We'll need more blood.
- Scalpel.

554
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:45,398
- Hold onto the blood bag.
- Grey, help retract.

555
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,842
Richardson retractor.

556
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,470
- Lap.
- Got it.

557
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,071
Clamp.

558
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,354
Retractor.

559
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,515
Quick, please.
Give me some sponges. Sponges.

560
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,149
- Bovie suction here.
- I'm in.

561
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,923
Lap sponges. Hand me the cautery.

562
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,932
Her aorta's shredded.
She's gonna bleed out.

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,695
We have no rhythm.

564
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,100
Doctors, he's losing pressure.

565
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,233
- He's bleeding.
- Let's go.

566
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,638
Transitioning.

567
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,041
Change out.
Everybody change gloves.

568
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,104
What about her?
We can't just abandon her!

569
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,117
- I'm going in.
- We can't abandon her!

570
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,710
I'm going in stem to stern. Scalpel.

571
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,288
Sternal saw.

572
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,087
Give me the sternal saw.

573
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,527
Cautery.

574
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,087
- Let's go.
- Meredith.

575
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,291
Dr. Grey.

576
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,425
- Meredith!
- What about her?

577
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,801
We cannot just abandon her.
We have an obligation.

578
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,464
I'll take care of this.

579
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,175
Meredith, come on,
there was too much damage.

580
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:57,340
There was never anything we could do.
We have to let her go.

581
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,742
Time of death 3:49.

582
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,539
- Good morning.
- How's Brooke?

583
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,345
She's good.

584
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,476
- And the baby?
- He came through, too.

585
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,219
So, have you made a decision yet,
Dr. Stevens?

586
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,518
I'm sorry?

587
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,788
Whether or not you're going to hate me.

588
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,891
You're Meredith's friend. I'm
the wicked witch who cheated on Dr...

589
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,197
Wait, what is it that you guys call him?

590
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,363
McDreamy.

591
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,805
Right. God, doesn't that embarrass him?

592
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,972
Yeah, I think it does.

593
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,412
- By all rights, you should hate me.
- I guess.

594
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,645
Except that I'm gonna
be staying in town for a while.

595
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,117
- You are?
- Yes.

596
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,349
And you show a real gift
with my specialty.

597
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,018
And I have a lot to teach,
if you want to learn.

598
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,752
So...

599
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:26,628
So, when you decide how important it is
for you to hate me, let me know.

600
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,813
Did she uh... Did she suffer?

601
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,417
No. Her injuries prevented her from...

602
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,025
No, she wasn't in any pain.

603
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:56,191
Good. That's...

604
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:05,336
She asked me to... to tell you that...

605
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:13,248
She wanted you to know
that if love were enough...

606
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,654
that if love were enough,
that she'd still be here with you.

607
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,401
<i> As surgeons,</i>

608
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,173
<i>there are so many things</i>
<i>we have to know.</i>

609
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,049
- Fine work, Dr. Karev.
- Thank you, sir.

610
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,421
<i>We have to know we have what it takes.</i>

611
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,865
<i>We have to know</i>
<i>how to take care of our patients.</i>

612
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,932
Tom is doing just fine.

613
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,789
<i>And how to take care of each other.</i>

614
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,144
- OK?
- Yeah.

615
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,800
<i>Eventually we even have to figure out...</i>

616
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,465
<i>how to take care of ourselves.</i>

617
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,909
<i>As surgeons, we have to be in the know.</i>

618
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,181
<i>But as human beings,</i>

619
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,392
<i>sometimes</i>
<i>it's better to stay in the dark.</i>

620
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:45,733
<i>Because in the dark,</i>
<i>there may be fear...</i>

621
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,073
<i>but there's also hope.</i>

622
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,588
Better get cleaned up.
Rounds. Five minutes.
