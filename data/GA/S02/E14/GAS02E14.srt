00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,992
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,334
- How did your test go?
- Good, but I won't know for a few days.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,169
- We're pulling for you.
- We are?

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:12,143
You cannot kick me
while I'm doing my job.

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,614
I thought you could give me
an answer to my question.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,311
About you... moving in.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,383
I have a dog.

8
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,653
That's not a dog.
It's a hyena dressed in dog clothing.

9
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,216
I love dogs.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,988
<i> As doctors</i>
<i>we're trained to be skeptical...</i>

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,468
<i>because our patients</i>
<i>lie to us all the time.</i>

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>The rule is: every patient is a liar</i>
<i>until proven honest.</i>

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,112
Why aren't you prepping for rounds
and stealing the good cases?

14
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,313
- No reason.
- No reason?

15
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>Lying is bad. Or so we're told.</i>

16
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,856
<i>Constantly, from birth.</i>

17
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,226
<i>"Honesty is the best policy."</i>

18
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,561
<i>"The truth shall set you free."</i>

19
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,932
<i>"I chopped down the cherry tree."</i>
<i>Whatever.</i>

20
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,870
- I'm waiting for McDreamy.
- I'm avoiding Burke.

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,306
- Why are you avoiding Burke?
- He thinks I moved in with him.

22
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,936
- Why are you...
- McDreamy's doing me a favor.

23
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,209
- Thinks you moved in with him?
- You're calling him "McDreamy?"

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,740
<i>The fact is, lying is a necessity.</i>

25
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,556
Thank you for this,
with the needles and blood.

26
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,059
They won't accept her
without a family history.

27
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,688
I'm happy to get your mom
into the clinical trial.

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,755
Even with the needles and blood.

29
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,904
All done. How's that feel?

30
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,101
<i>We lie to ourselves because the truth...</i>

31
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,041
<i>The truth freaking hurts.</i>

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,943
It feels good.

33
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,044
- Burke thinks you moved in with him?
- It's not important.

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,555
- You're calling Derek "McDreamy" again?
- It's nothing.

35
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,386
- All right, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

36
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,859
- Stop repeating what I say.
- Stop asking me questions.

37
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,264
Cujo has to go!

38
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,962
He peed on my bed. My bed, Meredith.

39
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,061
- He's our dog.
- No, he's not my dog.

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,573
You two bought him
without even asking me.

41
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,667
We rescued him from certain death.

42
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,575
Come on, you guys.

43
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,140
I'm putting my foot down.
Either the dog moves out or I do.

44
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,913
Foot. Down. Now.

45
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,285
Me or the dog. Which is it?

46
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,760
- You hesitated. She hesitated.
- You hesitated?

47
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,027
I didn't hesitate. I was thinking.

48
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,126
You have to think about it? Fine.

49
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,171
I'm moving out right now.

50
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,102
Later. I'm moving out later.
Because right now, I have rounds.

51
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,870
- Tell me that is not a dog.
- It's not a dog.

52
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,610
- Let's go.
- Rick Freeark, 29.

53
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,281
Severed three fingers on his left hand.
Controlled the bleeding.

54
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,790
Vitals stable.
Gave him five of morphine.

55
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,123
- Fingers?
- Had trouble retrieving them,

56
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,528
so we took off. Rig behind us found 'em.
They're iced and ready.

57
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,964
- Ten minutes out.
- Continue with IV fluids

58
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,697
and start a course of antibiotics.
Yang, wait outside for the fingers.

59
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,068
Can you sew them on?

60
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,734
They sewed that guy's penis back
on after his wife chopped it off.

61
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
Penises and fingers
are like apples and oranges.

62
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,414
- How did it happen?
- I was loading my gear on to the truck

63
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,108
for a gig and they got caught.

64
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,515
- You're a musician?
- I play the guitar.

65
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,113
You can sew them back on, right?
This is not that big a deal, right?

66
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,817
Oh, dude,
I better not be out of the band.

67
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,729
The cuts look clean. That's good.

68
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,566
Clean severed makes reattachment easier.

69
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,971
I'm not going to lie to you.
If the surgery is successful,

70
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,137
we're looking at a long recovery
with lots of physical therapy.

71
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,545
- You smoke?
- Why?

72
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:14,053
Cigarettes constrict blood vessels. I've
seen grafts fail over a few cigarettes.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,678
So what are you saying?

74
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:20,055
I smoke a cigarette after my operation
and boom! My fingers fall off?

75
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,892
No. First they turn black and necrotic
and then they fall off.

76
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,895
Well... I don't smoke, so...

77
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:33,962
Really? Because judging by
the nicotine stains, your fingers do.

78
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,907
Anybody out there?

79
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,469
Hello?

80
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,412
Don't look at me.

81
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,715
She had hip replacement surgery a
month ago and was discharged last week.

82
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,017
Then why is she still here?

83
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,616
Because I am not a bouncer
and this is not a nightclub.

84
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,027
I am doing what I can, with extremely
limited staff and resources

85
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,828
and if you have a problem with that,
take it up with the chief.

86
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,371
~ <i>Don't know why</i>

87
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,499
~ <i>There's no sun up in the sky...</i>

88
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,675
- Mrs. Larson's got to go.
- If she refuses to go, what can I do?

89
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,238
She's 78 and non-ambulatory.
You have the upper hand here. Use it.

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,081
Karev, can I talk to you for a second?

91
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,246
- Results of your Medical Board exams.
- Thanks.

92
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,298
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Yeah, I'll open it.

93
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:40,202
~ <i>I'm weary all the time</i> ~

94
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,105
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Mrs. Larson, I'm Dr. O'Malley.

95
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:51,674
Oh! An Irishman. I love the Irish.
They have a sparkle.

96
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,879
You can see it in the eye.
And the swagger.

97
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,390
Come on, Dr. O'Malley.
Show me the swagger.

98
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,822
The eyes are right,

99
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,994
but you'll have to work on the swagger.

100
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,167
- Mrs. Larson...
- Call me Sophie.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,869
Now, be a doll and bring me a remote.

102
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,640
This one's busted.

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,305
Sophie.

104
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,375
I can't bring you one because you're
no longer a patient at this hospital.

105
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,252
According to your chart, you have
a room at the Sugar Maple Nursing Home.

106
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,089
I'm staying
until my daughter's house is ready.

107
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,527
She's converting her den
into my bedroom.

108
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,066
She's doing it in a shade of pink.

109
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,661
Now... bring me a remote, Irish.

110
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,902
I'm going to sing... until you get back.

111
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,911
~ <i>Can't go on</i>

112
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,312
~ <i>Everything I have is gone</i>

113
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,644
~ <i>Stormy weather...</i>

114
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,207
Coming right up.

115
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,813
Yumi Miyazaki, 22. Presented this
morning with persistent hiccups.

116
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,020
She was given 50 chlorpromazine which
stopped them, but then they returned,

117
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,894
so she needs a surgical consult
to rule out esophageal perforation.

118
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,330
- When did your hiccups start?
- A few days ago.

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,925
- She doesn't speak English.
- You her boyfriend?

120
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,265
Her coach.

121
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,897
- She's an athlete?
- Yumi is a competitive eater.

122
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,669
Eating is a sport?

123
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,973
Miyazaki. Yeah, yeah.

124
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,910
She's like a rock star in Japan.

125
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,175
Again, eating is a sport?

126
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,583
Tell her I saw her on TV. Tell her
I'm an athlete too. I'm a wrestler...

127
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,068
She wonders how a wrestler
got smart enough to be a doctor.

128
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,434
Most wrestlers she knows are dumb.

129
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,104
Tell her she hasn't been hanging out
at the right gyms.

130
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,201
How about instead you tell her
that a persistent hiccup

131
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,679
could be an indication
of something much more serious?

132
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,739
Schedule an esophagogram.

133
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,547
She's competing this afternoon
at the Taste of Seattle.

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,555
Can't you give her
a stronger dose of that drug? It worked.

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,113
Did the hiccups come back?

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,557
- Yes, but...
- Then it didn't work.

137
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,497
- Dr. Bailey?
- Be quiet.

138
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,493
Dr. Bailey, are you OK?

139
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,839
All right,
somebody page Addison Shepherd.

140
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,279
There he is. Heartbeat's strong.

141
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,581
Since there's no dilation or effacement,

142
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,349
it looks like nothing more
than Braxton Hicks.

143
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,584
Except?

144
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,823
I know the mild-concerned tone.
I've used it myself from time to time.

145
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,096
Sometimes false labor
is the body's way of saying "slow down."

146
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,293
I'm a surgeon.

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,394
I understand the realities of your job

148
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,237
but you need to understand the realities
of your pregnancy. Take it easy.

149
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:07,211
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- You can help me get up off this table.

150
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,238
Dr. Bailey?

151
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:14,548
The GI lab has a couple of questions
about Miss Miyazaki's esophagogram.

152
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,349
All right. Let's go.

153
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,591
Dr. Stevens.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,158
Keep an eye on her. Watch for painful
contractions, more than five an hour.

155
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,064
Anything that could indicate
preterm labor.

156
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,763
The favor's not for me, Stevens.
You know that.

157
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,375
Naomi Cline, 43.

158
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,140
Had her tricuspid valve replaced
three years ago with a porcine valve.

159
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,305
Oh, Naomi.

160
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,544
I'm surprised to see you
back again so soon.

161
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,745
Pig valves usually hold up 10-15 years.

162
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,618
Yours is degenerating
too quickly for my comfort.

163
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,783
Oh, heart-valve, schmart-valve.

164
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,794
I got married, Dr. Burke.

165
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,126
I found him. My true love.

166
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,861
My "you jump, I jump."

167
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,699
Look. Isn't it beautiful?

168
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,868
And look...
Iook at that beautiful, beautiful man.

169
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,445
- We met in the grocery store.
- Oh, honey.

170
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,382
Congratulations.
It's good to see you so happy.

171
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,317
Yeah.

172
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,681
So, Naomi's heart valve?
What does this mean?

173
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,923
There's a cause for your wife's valve
failure that remains undiagnosed.

174
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,055
Theories, Grey?

175
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,259
Rheumatic fever,
chronic use of migraine meds...

176
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:42,238
...or IV narcotics
could all cause valve disease, sir.

177
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,038
Oh, I don't use drugs. Don't need 'em.

178
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,908
I've got Tom.

179
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,779
He's my drug. Aren't you, baby?

180
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,851
- She's high, Dr. Burke.
- She's in love. She's happy.

181
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,152
Nobody is that happy. She's on drugs.

182
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,558
Run a tox screen.
But Naomi doesn't strike me as a liar.

183
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,960
If she says no drugs,
then it's no drugs.

184
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,467
- You develop a sixth sense about this.
- Everybody's a liar.

185
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,930
Dr. Grey, is that a dog?

186
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,666
No.

187
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,034
We need to keep this elevated, OK?

188
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,545
I'm gonna check in on you
in a little bit.

189
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,416
Yang.

190
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,452
You were a little harsh in there.

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,717
He was lying. Your "harsh"
is another man's "refreshing."

192
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,591
Well, he's in shock. He lost his fingers
and his only remaining habit in one day.

193
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,595
We need to be compassionate.

194
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,654
- Compassionate?
- It's an emotion.

195
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,190
- Have you ever heard of it?
- Have you?

196
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,864
Barely back on her feet and you've
got her calling you McDreamy again.

197
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,705
I was telling the patient the truth.
You might want to try it sometime.

198
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,418
Remotes.

199
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,518
- More remotes.
- O'Malley?

200
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,421
I'm getting a remote for Mrs. Larson.

201
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,497
What happened to the upper hand?

202
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,094
Have you met Mrs. Larson, sir?

203
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,763
Why do you think she's been here
this long? In a private room.

204
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,830
She handled you, too?

205
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,506
Well, she sang for the troops, you know?

206
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,277
Can't we just keep her here until her
room at her daughter's house is ready?

207
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,944
No, we can't.

208
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,614
Not on surgical service, anyway.

209
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,488
Oh. OK.

210
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,655
- But... some other service?
- I'm the Chief, O'Malley.

211
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,131
I can't condone turfing patients
onto other services.

212
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,062
You hear me, O'Malley?

213
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>Any available IC nurse to OR 2.</i>

214
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,536
I'm missing my program, Irish.

215
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,512
And I don't see a remote
in that hot little hand.

216
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,913
Your urine output has increased slightly
since yesterday.

217
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,384
I'm going to have to
take you to gynecology

218
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,286
to make sure
you don't have a prolapsed uterus.

219
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,985
Honey, my uterus
hasn't been an issue for 30 years.

220
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,722
I know. But it might be an issue now.

221
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:23,099
You know, one that could
keep you here in the hospital for tests.

222
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,973
You drive. I'll ride shotgun.

223
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,641
- You're not moving out, George.
- Oh, yes, I am.

224
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,979
I gave an ultimatum. Threw down the
gauntlet. I drew my line in the sand.

225
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,145
Well, un-give, un-throw, un-draw.

226
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,122
A man does not give an ultimatum
and then back down.

227
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,183
Meredith had a choice
and she chose the dog.

228
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,626
A girl chose a dog over you?

229
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,596
- Yes.
- No.

230
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,499
- Are we going to do this or what?
- Yeah. Let's go.

231
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,978
- Don't start without me.
- We won't start if Izzie doesn't focus.

232
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,514
- Come on.
- What should I put?

233
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,073
- I don't know.
- Destructive hell-dog available.

234
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,550
- Not helping.
- Fine.

235
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,520
Playful, protective puppy
needs loving home.

236
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,851
Good.

237
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,887
- Hey, George.
- Don't talk to me.

238
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,292
You'll mess up my game,
and I'm in the zone.

239
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,593
OK. What are you doing?

240
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,565
- It's a flyer...
- Izzie, come on.

241
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,535
OK. Keep your panties on.

242
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,765
- All right.
- No touching!

243
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,875
Go.

244
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,383
Advertising for a home for Doc?
I said I'd do it.

245
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,582
And you haven't. And you won't.
And I don't want George to leave.

246
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,921
Say he's not house-broken.

247
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:59,492
- What? It's the truth.
- So you want me to put the truth? Fine.

248
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,432
Vicious, hyper devil-mutt
is available and will pee on your bed.

249
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,335
He's yours too. We got him together.

250
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,775
We got him together, but he's not
my dog. He's not your dog either.

251
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,940
He doesn't even know us. We're not
home enough for him to know us.

252
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,606
Ha-ha!

253
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,414
- You cheated.
- I kicked your asses.

254
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,187
~ <i>You wanna be me, but you can't be me</i>

255
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,385
~ <i>You wanna be me, but you...</i>

256
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,958
- Uh-oh.
- She's gonna blow.

257
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,003
"The surgical floor is a dumping ground
for patients who aren't even surgical."

258
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,701
"We are overworked and exhausted.
This makes..."

259
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,210
The nurses again?
Can't you do something?

260
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,974
You used to be one of them.
Don't you speak "nurse?"

261
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,642
That's why you don't
get any respect from the nurses.

262
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,619
- Surgical arrogance.
- I'm not arrogant.

263
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,680
You're killing them with that workload.
Look at the board.

264
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,248
What? That's a beautiful board.

265
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,388
It's a crowded board.
We need more nurses.

266
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,963
Mr. Kamaji? This is probably
what's causing her hiccups.

267
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,237
- A tear in the lining of her esophagus.
- Can you fix it?

268
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,301
Yes, surgically. Sooner the better.

269
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,348
After today,
her schedule is clear until March.

270
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,283
No, her schedule is clear now.
She can't compete today.

271
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,821
And if she enjoys
the taste of solid food,

272
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,346
I recommend giving up the sport
for something a little less aggressive.

273
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,825
Say, boxing.

274
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,454
I see.

275
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,866
Could you give us some privacy please?

276
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,974
Karev, get the translator up here.

277
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,707
Let's make sure
she's getting the whole truth.

278
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,218
- You know?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,116
- Busted.
- Put that out.

280
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,987
Sorry.

281
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,252
I've gotta prep you for surgery.

282
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,624
Can you ask your friends to leave?

283
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,219
Love you.

284
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,097
I wasn't gonna light 'em.
I was just holding them.

285
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,830
OK.

286
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,237
- Seriously. Take them. Throw them out.
- You hang on to them.

287
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,175
- Seriously, I wasn't gonna smoke.
- I don't care. Do what you want.

288
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,581
You don't think
I'm gonna be able to quit, do you?

289
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,810
No. I don't.

290
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,882
~ <i>I'm lonely all the time...</i>

291
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,482
Oh, no.

292
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,419
Oh, yeah.

293
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,657
Irish.

294
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,328
That nice lady doctor in gynecology

295
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,430
said that,
since I had a hysterectomy back in '74,

296
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,169
I don't have a uterus to prolapse.

297
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,072
- Damn it.
- I've been feeling a bit feverish.

298
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:07,585
A woman my age with a fever
could be an indication of...

299
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,451
any number of awful diseases.

300
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,889
They took your temperature an hour ago.
It was normal.

301
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,926
I am sorry, Sophie, but I am
going to have to call your daughter.

302
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,794
I'm telling you, I'm warm.

303
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,072
That must be one hell of a dog.

304
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,638
Excuse me?

305
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,446
With those eyes...

306
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,647
and those nice firm hands.

307
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,092
A girl who chooses a dog over you...

308
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,459
It must be one hell of a dog.

309
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,030
Mrs. Cline's tox screen and titer
both came back negative.

310
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,265
I was sure I was right about that.

311
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,365
Gonna have to adjust your world view.

312
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,240
- There are people who don't lie.
- Maybe.

313
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:11,476
Although, frankly, the drug use
would have explained the valve failure.

314
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,815
- So how do we proceed?
- Schedule Mrs. Cline for a surgery.

315
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,616
OK.

316
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,888
Do you want to come over for dinner?

317
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,985
- What?
- Dinner.

318
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,190
- Our place. Mine and Cristina's.
- Why?

319
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,297
You're Cristina's friend. I want her to
feel welcome to have our friends round.

320
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:38,002
- So she moved in with you?
- Yes. Didn't she tell you?

321
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,603
Of course she told me.
Why wouldn't she tell me?

322
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,807
She's in, right?

323
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:48,046
- Which, you know, I think is great.
- Right.

324
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,225
Thank you.

325
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,194
I just came from Mr. Freeark's room.

326
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,530
He's convinced he won't be able
to quit smoking. Says you agree.

327
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,933
He asked my opinion.

328
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,471
- Want me to apologize?
- Tell him you're wrong.

329
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,976
You're having a bad day.
Your favorite uncle died of lung cancer.

330
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,775
Say whatever you need to. Get him to
believe this is about you, not him.

331
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,338
If he thinks he can't quit, he won't.

332
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,749
- Then we shouldn't do the surgery.
- Fine.

333
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,982
- What is your problem? I'm your boss...
- You're not right now.

334
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,116
We're in an elevator,
your specialty for McDreamy moments.

335
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,660
- Dr. Yang...
- For a moment I'm not Dr. Yang,

336
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,891
you're not Dr. Shepherd.
You're the guy who screwed up my friend.

337
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,765
The guy who drove her to get a dog
because her boyfriend lied...

338
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,325
I never lied to her.

339
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,701
I know a liar when I see one
because I'm a liar.

340
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,332
Want me to lie to the patient?
Fine, I'll lie.

341
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,007
Yumi?

342
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,178
Hey. The translator's here.
Where's the patient Miyazaki?

343
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,378
She left with her friend 20 minutes ago.

344
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,388
- She wasn't discharged.
- Sorry, we're short-staffed.

345
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,687
I assumed someone else
had done the paperwork.

346
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,851
Damn it.

347
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,663
Come on! Damn it.

348
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,498
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I gotta get a candy bar.

349
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,130
You're about to have surgery.
You can't eat.

350
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,902
- Mr. Freeark, please.
- My dad's Mr. Freeark.

351
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,500
- Well...
- He's got a combover

352
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,309
- and an annoying wife named Kimberley.
- Rick. Listen.

353
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,819
- Earlier I was out of line.
- No. You got me to think.

354
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,217
I don't want to be a guy sitting
in a bar with a stump for a hand,

355
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,125
having a smoke ten years down the line,

356
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,822
bragging about how
I was better than Dave Navarro.

357
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,389
Yeah, you don't want
to be creepy bitter guy.

358
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,697
Here's the thing.

359
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,295
My last cigarette was this morning.

360
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,273
Only I didn't know
it was my last cigarette.

361
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,384
What the hell do you think you're doing?

362
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,320
McDreamy's being McDouchey.

363
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,094
He's making me stand at the back of the
OR while he reattaches Rick's fingers.

364
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,831
I mean, I can't even touch a retractor.
I hate him.

365
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,341
Truth.
Did you move in with Burke or not?

366
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:29,103
I told him I moved in with him
but I'm keeping my old apartment.

367
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,639
What? I sleep with Burke every night.
My clothes are there.

368
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,779
- I still have my apartment. Big deal.
- You have to tell him.

369
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,380
Actually, I don't.

370
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,153
So...

371
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,595
I'm supposed to go to dinner
at your fake apartment

372
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,862
- with the guy you fake live with?
- I wouldn't have you over to dinner.

373
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,130
- That's weird.
- This is my point.

374
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,298
- Stop with the lying.
- And you're being honest?

375
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,402
The last time you called him McDreamy,
you were all atwitter with love.

376
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,572
- We're just friends.
- Uh-huh?

377
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,672
We are.

378
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,345
- West Nile Virus? Are you kidding me?
- No. Look at her.

379
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,821
She's feverish. Weaker than this
morning. Could be decompensating.

380
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:17,155
She's been here for a month. You seen
any mosquitoes in this hospital lately?

381
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,756
Oh, such a handsome young man.

382
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,659
Those chocolatey eyes.

383
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,237
In order to test you, Mrs. Larson,
we have to do a spinal tap.

384
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,299
Will you be doing it?

385
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,610
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:42,316
Well, then... call me Sophie.

387
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,051
Nice meeting you, Irish!

388
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,561
So, if you'll just sign here
we can go ahead

389
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,430
- and schedule you for surgery.
- OK.

390
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,493
You know,
you are a gorgeous young woman.

391
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,334
Look at you.

392
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,471
You should smile more.

393
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,876
<i>Any available IV nurse to the ER.</i>

394
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,546
Mr. Cline.

395
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,446
Oh. Uh...

396
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,816
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

397
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,518
Don't tell her you saw me.

398
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:25,757
I'm not sure that I'm going to go in.

399
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,232
She's... she can be exhausting.

400
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,932
Yeah, she's... really happy.

401
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:38,004
You know, I thought it was just
falling in love, the wedding,

402
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,068
but I was hoping the honeymoon
would be over by now.

403
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,014
I mean... it's not normal. Right?

404
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,979
Nobody's that happy.

405
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,820
- Run another tox screen on Naomi Cline.
- On whose orders?

406
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,882
Dr. Burke's, of course.

407
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:10,597
I'm sorry to bother you. The paramedics
are on their way in with Yumi Miyazaki.

408
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,133
She collapsed at the Taste of Seattle
and is vomiting blood.

409
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:18,342
Damned fool. Probably tore
her esophagus in two by now.

410
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,112
Are you OK?

411
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,327
Complications of Boerhaave's Syndrome.
Go.

412
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,388
Pleural effusion, sepsis, shock.

413
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,902
She's cyanotic with shallow
breath sounds. BP 76 over 42,

414
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,904
tachycardia to the 130's.
Started her on high flow O2.

415
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,066
- On her second bolus of saline.
- Let's get her to the OR.

416
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,235
They're ready and waiting.

417
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,745
Her coach should be
the one on this gurney.

418
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,809
Let's keep our eyes on the prize, Karev.
Saving this woman's life.

419
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,355
- I'll meet you guys up there.
- Me too.

420
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,414
Hey, hey. What are you gonna do?

421
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,891
- Punch him out?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,088
You're gonna kick his ass,
get yourself kicked out of the program

423
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,427
before you open your scores
in case you failed?

424
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,933
God, you're such an idiot.

425
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:15,429
Dr. Karev, how do I begin
the esophagomyotomy?

426
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,068
Cut proximal and distal to the tear
to expose the mucosal defect.

427
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:24,639
Correct. Then we'll move
to the débridement of the defect...

428
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,711
Dr. Bailey,
those aren't Braxton Hicks contractions.

429
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,054
I believe you are in preterm labor.

430
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,767
Why didn't you call me sooner?

431
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,803
All right. Get out of here.

432
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,636
- I was gonna fashion a gastric patch.
- I taught you the procedure.

433
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,369
Now leave.

434
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,645
The clamp.

435
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,284
<i> Dr. Cloner to obstetrics.</i>

436
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,057
I got paged Dr. Grey.

437
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,494
Jeffery wanted to give me the results of
the extensive blood work that I ordered.

438
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,157
You forged my signature?

439
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,225
- That's really bad, right?
- Yeah. That's really bad.

440
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,103
Naomi is not on drugs.
The tests came back negative.

441
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,665
- They did?
- They did. Again.

442
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,475
Next time you forge my signature,
let me know. Save me a trip.

443
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,280
That's it?

444
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,186
You're not gonna yell "Damn it, Grey"
and storm out?

445
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,225
- I will if you want me to.
- No.

446
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:45,251
Dr. Burke. Here's another one. Her
serotonin level. It's through the roof.

447
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,527
Dr. Grey. You took a detailed history.

448
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,131
- When did Mrs. Cline develop asthma?
- After the first surgery. Why?

449
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,867
We found a carcinoid tumor in the lung.

450
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,535
Very rare.
Almost impossible to diagnose.

451
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,672
It masks itself as a bunch
of seemingly unrelated symptoms:

452
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:08,014
- adult onset asthma, valve failure...
- Increased serotonin in the blood.

453
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,520
Which creates a false sense of euphoria.

454
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,988
So, Naomi's not actually this happy?
She just has a tumor?

455
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,326
- Exactly.
- Thank God.

456
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:24,460
You people with your tumors. I tell you,
I'm infected with love.

457
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,198
I'm sorry.
Your body is lying to your mind.

458
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,264
Oh, let the lie continue. Right, baby?

459
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,211
- How soon can you cure her?
- Tomorrow.

460
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,340
If all goes well,
Naomi goes back to normal.

461
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,543
Great. Thank you both.

462
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,952
Thank you for not chewing me out
for forging your signature.

463
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,759
Thank you.

464
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,890
I know it was probably you
who convinced Cristina.

465
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,560
She's very strong,
but she listens to you.

466
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,729
If you told her to move in...

467
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,410
Anyway, thank you.

468
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,912
No problem.

469
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,917
Do you have any sensation
in your left arm at all?

470
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,694
No.

471
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,157
Actually, could I watch?

472
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,429
I wanna see every blood vessel
and nerve I'm gonna screw up

473
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,032
if I ever smoke again.

474
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,839
Not that I'm gonna. Ever again.

475
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,940
I smoked my last cigarette.

476
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,919
OK. Let's get started.

477
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,956
The nursing home
said she never showed up.

478
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,721
- How exactly is that possible?
- She wouldn't leave.

479
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,992
My mother is old and infirm.
You couldn't make her leave?

480
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,965
Have you met your mother?

481
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,832
Fine. Where is she now?

482
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,702
Hi. She's in the
Infectious Diseases Service.

483
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,903
Infectious disease. Since when
does she have an infectious disease?

484
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,775
She doesn't.
She just doesn't want to leave.

485
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,543
- She's unbelievable.
- Yeah, she is.

486
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,518
- Is her room ready? I can get her.
- They've had the room ready for weeks.

487
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,182
No, not at Sugar Maple.
I meant at your house.

488
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,522
- I'm sorry?
- The pink room.

489
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,824
At your house.

490
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:37,200
<i> We got a car that matches the</i>
<i>description. Want to head over there?</i>

491
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,532
- Hi, Sophie.
- Irish.

492
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,198
What a wonderful surprise.

493
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,707
You won't catch my disease, will you?

494
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,903
No, I think I'll be OK.

495
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,944
Sophie, your daughter was just here.

496
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:03,651
Nursing homes are for old people.

497
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,498
I know I'm elderly.

498
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,028
I do know that.

499
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,698
But if I have to go to that place...

500
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,605
I'm afraid I'll become old.

501
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,913
I don't think that's possible.

502
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,524
Oh.

503
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,395
You know that I would
keep you here if I could.

504
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:44,765
Oh, no, darling.
You can't waste any more time with me.

505
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,101
You have to go balls out with the dog.

506
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,434
Excuse me?

507
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,533
So she chose an animal over you.

508
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,511
So what? Women are fools.

509
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,411
That's old news.

510
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:02,680
But life's too short
for you to give in, Irish.

511
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,056
So fight.

512
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,460
You fight for what's yours.

513
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,881
Now that, my friend... is a swagger.

514
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:41,720
I'll be closing the peritoneal
cavity with zero chromic sutures.

515
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,590
Thank you.

516
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,229
Chief.

517
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,659
Let's get back to it.
Pull back on that retractor.

518
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:58,300
Give me more suction. I'll
need a sponge on a stick. More suction.

519
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,404
- What's going on?
- I tried, but you wouldn't listen.

520
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,747
It is now 6:07. The second shift nurses
start at six. They're not coming in.

521
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,788
Do you know what a sick out
will do to this hospital?

522
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,619
I've already put in the call for temps.

523
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,488
- What's this?
- Notification.

524
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,357
We go on strike in ten days.

525
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,267
Doing good, Yumi.
You're doing just fine.

526
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,073
We should get the translator.
She doesn't understand.

527
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,878
We'll be back.

528
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,814
What the hell are you doing here?

529
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,054
I never would have...

530
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,154
I thought she would be fine.

531
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,597
- I'm sorry.
- Don't tell me. Tell her.

532
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,863
Tell her how her career is over
because of you.

533
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,656
Way better than punching him out.

534
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,862
Hey, can you...

535
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,561
- You want me to open it?
- Yeah, I know, it's...

536
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,938
I can't.

537
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,978
- I shouldn't. I mean...
- You already think I'm an idiot.

538
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,910
It won't be any great shock.

539
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,763
Congratulations. You are not an idiot.

540
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,234
Except when you're being an idiot.

541
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,273
Good.

542
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,107
Hey, how's he doing?

543
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,848
Jonesing for a cigarette, but I think
he'll make it to the end of the day.

544
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,480
Good.

545
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,787
- I was being nice to her.
- OK.

546
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,421
I can be nice without being...

547
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,226
McDreamy. I know.

548
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,967
I really can.

549
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,434
OK.

550
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,631
OK, then.

551
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,772
Bed rest at home until the baby comes.
You do know what bed rest is, Miranda?

552
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,247
- Yeah. Hell.
- Hell with TV and books.

553
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,409
Here. It's from all of us.

554
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,525
I may be 47 months pregnant.

555
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,529
I may be on bed rest.

556
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,225
I may not be able to see my own feet.

557
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,495
But I am Dr. Bailey.

558
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,369
I hear everything. I know everything.

559
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,806
I am watching each and every one of you.

560
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,901
And I will return.

561
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,847
How many hours
do they expect us to work?

562
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,578
I agree.

563
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,510
Strike?

564
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,946
Strike.

565
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,628
You are all
a bunch of arrogant surgeons.

566
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,695
- Hey.
- Hey.

567
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,870
That was Izzie.
She refuses to take the dog home.

568
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,501
Mm-hm.

569
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:02,518
Fine. If you want me to tell Burke
I didn't move in, I'll tell him.

570
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,249
No. Don't.

571
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,053
- What?
- Don't tell him.

572
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,923
At least, not right now. Or tonight.

573
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,897
I just mean wait. It can wait.

574
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,129
I lied about Derek.

575
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,436
We're not just friends.

576
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,477
I mean, I'm not.

577
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,843
He's still McDreamy.

578
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,547
I know.

579
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,738
You don't get to choose.

580
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,242
Huh?

581
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,878
I know you've been going through a bad
time. I know you miss Shepherd.

582
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,152
And I know that your life has been
admittedly pretty unpleasant these days.

583
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,423
You get points for breathing in and out.
You get to be a little selfish.

584
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,488
But you don't get to
choose a dog over me.

585
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:29,238
I'm George.
I sleep down the hall from you.

586
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,104
I buy your tampons.

587
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:37,776
I have held your hand
every time you've asked.

588
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,587
I've earned the right to be seen,
to be respected,

589
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:49,285
to not have you think of me as less
than a dog that you got at the pound.

590
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,528
So...

591
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,332
I'm not moving out.

592
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,873
Whether you like it or not, I'm staying.

593
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:12,206
<i> No matter how hard we try</i>
<i>to ignore it or deny it,</i>

594
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,751
<i>eventually the lies fall away...</i>

595
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,459
I'm glad you moved in.

596
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,596
So am I.

597
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,004
<i>... whether we like it or not.</i>

598
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:51,386
OK, Doc. Let's go.

599
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,594
Hey, Doc. Hey, buddy.

600
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,929
- Hey.
- Welcome home.

601
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,762
He's beautiful.

602
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,500
- I brought his toys.
- Here's his food and his water dish.

603
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,132
Here.

604
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,678
Thanks for doing this.
I know it's a lot to ask.

605
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,236
It's all right.

606
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,049
It's just a dog.

607
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:23,245
Right? Come on, Doc.

608
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,333
- We'll just... wait by the car.
- OK.

609
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:48,035
So, he chews everything.

610
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,013
So don't leave anything out.

611
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,710
He hates cats
and small, little, yappy dogs.

612
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,446
- Oh, not house-broken.
- Oh.

613
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,753
- Probably should have told you that.
- Yeah.

614
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,864
You don't have to do this, you know?

615
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,634
Well, you know, I got all this land.
It's just going to waste.

616
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,338
Derek.

617
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,875
It's just a dog.
It doesn't mean anything. He'll be fine.

618
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,580
Yeah.

619
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,689
- OK. Good night.
- Good night.

620
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,027
<i>But here's the truth about the truth:</i>

621
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,334
<i>It hurts.</i>

622
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,773
<i>So... we lie.</i>
