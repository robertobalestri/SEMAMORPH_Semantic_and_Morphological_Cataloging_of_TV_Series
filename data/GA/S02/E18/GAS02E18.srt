00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,832
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,392
I'm George. We met at the mixer.

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,599
You had on a black dress,
strappy sandals, slit up the side.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,268
I've had this thing
for my roommate since day one.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,708
She's pretty great.

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,838
- Who's Thatch?
- My dad. Thatcher.

7
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,643
She never talks about him.

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,343
I'm glad you moved in.

9
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,113
Oh, so she moved in with you?

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,278
Didn't she tell you?

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,618
I know now
that when I go into my bedroom,

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,658
I'm going to see
my wife cheating on me

13
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,387
with Mark,
who happened to be my best friend.

14
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,830
<i> After careful consideration</i>
<i>and many sleepless nights,</i>

15
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,700
<i>here's what I've decided.</i>

16
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,467
<i>There's no such thing as a grown-up.</i>

17
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,345
<i>We move on, we move out,</i>

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>we move away from our families</i>
<i>and form our own.</i>

19
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,123
Oh, no. I'm all wet.

20
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,880
Hello?

21
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,786
No, Dr. Burke.

22
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,053
Yes?

23
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,767
Yes, I'll let her know.

24
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,672
That was your landlord.

25
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,236
He wants you to know
there's a minor flood in your apartment.

26
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,610
Your other apartment.

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,212
<i>But the basic insecurities,</i>

28
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,187
<i>the basic fears</i>

29
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,350
<i>and all those old wounds</i>
<i>just grow up with us.</i>

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,757
I'm exhausted.

31
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,226
Me, too.

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,163
<i>And just when we think that life</i>
<i>and circumstance have forced us</i>

33
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,225
<i>to truly, once and for all,</i>
<i>become an adult...</i>

34
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,566
I was at it all night
in the on-call room.

35
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,969
What's your excuse?

36
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,270
<i>Your mother says something like that.</i>

37
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,332
Mom.

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,777
I tell you, that man
makes me purr like a kitten.

39
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,836
Mom.

40
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,315
When he isn't making me
growl like a tiger.

41
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,682
Stop!

42
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,950
And my husband wonders
why I'm not interested in him anymore.

43
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,786
<i>Or, worse, something like that.</i>

44
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:44,228
If he had any balls at all
he would leave on his own.

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,891
No. He plays stupid.

46
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,934
He's waiting for me to kick him out.

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,492
I come home with a hickey...

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,733
A hickey, for God's sake,
like I'm some sex-crazed teenager.

49
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,071
Which, let's face it, these days, I am.

50
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,634
And what does Thatcher do?

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,339
Pretends he doesn't see it.

52
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,173
<i>We get bigger,</i>
<i>we get taller, we get older.</i>

53
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,120
<i>But for the most part,</i>
<i>we're still just a bunch of kids,</i>

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,717
<i>running around the playground,</i>
<i>trying desperately to fit in.</i>

55
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,318
You know, he's acting
like I committed a crime.

56
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,229
Like my apartment
is full of stolen goods.

57
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,290
He's acting like I kept my apartment

58
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,461
to hide stuff so I can
do illegal transplants for money.

59
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,473
Are you sure he's not just acting
like you lied about moving in?

60
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,066
What's wrong with you?

61
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,374
My mommy's a filthy whore.

62
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,721
- You have dirty in your eyes.
- You have dirty in your eyes.

63
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,923
I'm not doing dirty with you.
It was a one-time lapse in judgment.

64
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,359
Oh, it was
a four-time lapse in judgment.

65
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,061
- Well, it's not going to happen again.
- Oh, OK.

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,101
I'm serious.

67
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,036
We're friends. It didn't work
when we tried to be more.

68
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,094
So...

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,699
as fun as it was,
it's not going to happen again.

70
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,371
- Stop looking at me.
- I'm not, I'm rounding.

71
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,745
- I'm rounding, too.
- Fine.

72
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,951
Chuck Eaton, 54, has stage 3B
non-small-cell lung cancer

73
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:19,253
with possible invasion of the pleura
and a history of COPD.

74
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:23,785
He's had extensive chemo-radiotherapy
with minimal regression of the tumor.

75
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,629
He's been admitted
for radical en-bloc resection.

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,031
I was a smoker.

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,593
The, uh, oncologist...

78
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,068
He explained that I have a 25 percent
chance of surviving the surgery.

79
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,135
Well, unfortunately, that's about right.

80
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,411
If you should elect not to proceed,
we can make you more comfortable.

81
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,787
With all due respect, uh...

82
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,551
there's no way that you can make
a man dying a slow death comfortable.

83
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,923
I'll roll the dice.

84
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,259
How do I look?
Would you say I look nice?

85
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,392
You could use a little more lip gloss.

86
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,904
- Aw! You're mean.
- I'm just kidding. You look fine.

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,167
Seriously, how's my breath?

88
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,642
- George, would you just talk to her?
- Who? What?

89
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,236
Good morning, Dr. Bailey!

90
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,508
Hi, baby!

91
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,106
- Are the ORs up and running?
- Fully functional.

92
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,947
There is some smoke damage.

93
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,249
How about you?
Are you fully functional?

94
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,586
I'm fine. How's your husband?

95
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,591
Takin' him home tomorrow.

96
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,390
- Yes, we are. Yes. Yes.
- I know you're so cute. I know you are.

97
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,488
OK, this is not a tea party.

98
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,965
Go! Work! Save some lives!

99
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,124
Now!

100
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,370
Jake Burton, 15, has advanced
craniodiaphyseal dysplasia,

101
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,675
admitted after complaining of headaches.

102
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,580
- He's not a complainer.
- He's been having some nausea.

103
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,277
Really? OK. So, may I, please?

104
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,979
Jake, can I get you to sit up?

105
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,543
- Sure.
- All right. OK.

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,387
Now I want you to look
right here for me. Thank you.

107
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,461
You know, if you pretend
I'm a lion, it helps.

108
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,518
Sorry?

109
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,327
If you pretend I'm a lion,
instead of a messed-up kid,

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,666
you get a talking circus animal,
which is way easier to look at.

111
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,862
What's our immediate concern?

112
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,000
That the bony tumors
are encroaching on his brain.

113
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,586
Invasive non-small-cell
with a history of COPD?

114
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,086
That guy's pretty much a goner.

115
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,423
Sensitivity. I like that in a stranger.

116
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,226
- Are you new here?
- Visiting.

117
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,529
Confounded by all the rain
and it's only my first day in town.

118
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,030
- You get used to it.
- Makes me want to stay in bed all day.

119
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,907
We just met and you're talking
about bed. Not very subtle.

120
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,846
Subtle's never been my strong suit.

121
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,904
So...

122
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,009
do you go out with co-workers?

123
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,257
I... make it a rule not to.

124
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,227
Then I am so glad
that I don't work here.

125
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,126
Are you hitting on me?
In a hospital?

126
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,930
Would that be wrong?

127
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,362
Meredith.

128
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,033
Ow.

129
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,806
What the hell was that?

130
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,540
That was Mark.

131
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,216
Punching people
on my surgical floor!

132
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,253
My head of neurosurgery, punching out
people on my surgical floor!

133
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,129
- Put the ice pack on your hand.
- My hand is fine.

134
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,567
Put the ice on
your $2 million-a-year hand!

135
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,629
Now... would someone tell me
what the hell happened?

136
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,506
- That was Mark.
- Who's Mark?

137
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,977
He and Derek used
to work together back in New York.

138
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,780
And, uh...

139
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,589
they were...
we were all... close friends.

140
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,018
Until...

141
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,198
Derek found us in bed together.

142
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,164
- You put your weight behind it?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,841
Well, all right, then.

144
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,442
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I have no idea.

145
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,589
Derek and I always did have
the same taste in women.

146
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,058
Excuse me?

147
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,220
You're Derek's lusty intern, right?

148
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,265
I heard about you
all the way back in New York.

149
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,993
You're famous.

150
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,629
Well, I heard about you
all the way here in Seattle.

151
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,037
So I guess we have a lot in common.

152
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,733
We're the dirty mistresses.

153
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,274
I suppose we are.

154
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,614
My $400-an-hour shrink says it's...

155
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,516
because behind
this rugged and confident exterior

156
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,986
I'm self-destructive and self-Ioathing

157
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,387
to an almost pathological degree.

158
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,687
Hey, we do have a lot in common.

159
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,625
You know, it's funny.

160
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,684
Der...

161
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,627
Derek walks in on me
naked with his wife,

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,668
actually in the throes.

163
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,235
And he just turns around and walks away.

164
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,243
But he sees me
so much as talking to you,

165
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,179
and I'm on the ground bleeding.

166
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,573
Interesting, don't you think?

167
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,217
- What are you doing?
- You need stitches.

168
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,090
I know. Hold the mirror.

169
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,105
- Why is he suturing his own face?
- To turn me on.

170
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,110
Because he's Mark Sloan,

171
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,613
the go-to plastic surgeon
on the East Coast.

172
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,342
The guy Addison slept with?

173
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,613
- Can't really blame her, can you?
- No, not really.

174
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,085
Yes, you can.

175
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,952
McSexy wants an X-ray
to check for fractures

176
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,992
and I think
it's a bad idea if I take him.

177
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,357
- Why? Why?
- I'm on it!

178
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,755
- Why is it a bad idea?
- McSexy?

179
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,820
No?

180
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,127
Mc Yummy.

181
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,190
No.

182
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:38,961
McSteamy.

183
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,165
- Ah, there it is.
- Yep.

184
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,675
Ugh! Just...

185
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,372
choking back some McVomit.

186
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,336
Ooh.

187
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,440
I saw her first.

188
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,078
The night she met Shepherd,
I had her ear.

189
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,485
We talked...

190
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,621
and I can't even remember what I said.

191
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,355
When you don't have sex for a while,
you sort of forget how good it is

192
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,661
- and you don't really need it as much.
- Yeah, that doesn't happen to guys.

193
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,533
It's like a beast.
A beast that was asleep for a long...

194
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,402
long time,
and now the beast is wide awake

195
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:19,069
and wants to be fed
and the food that Alex gave it was...

196
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,442
It was good food, George.

197
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,708
Something needs to be done
about your taste.

198
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,307
You're jealous
because your beast is asleep.

199
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,375
Nah. My beast isn't asleep.

200
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,354
My beast never sleeps.

201
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,922
Mr. Eaton.
Do you need a hand with that?

202
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,695
Um, if you could set up the tripod,
that'd be very helpful.

203
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,895
Are you...? What are you doing?

204
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,571
I'm dying, dear.

205
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,541
One in four?

206
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,170
I've never done well
with odds like that.

207
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,909
Some people are lucky.
I just never have been.

208
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:02,477
The camera is for posterity.
Saying goodbye.

209
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,580
Do you want me
to hold the camera for you?

210
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,716
You're very kind. Thank you.

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,765
OK. We're recording.

212
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,300
This is, uh, a message
for Suzie Zelman, my...

213
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,709
my college sweetheart
and the love of my life.

214
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,908
Suzie, I loved you with my whole heart.

215
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,448
And I never would
have stopped loving you

216
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,390
if you hadn't been the vilest whore
to ever walk the planet Earth.

217
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,790
You deserve that...

218
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,955
that drunken imbecile
that you slept with and then married.

219
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,332
And when at the reunion,

220
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,960
I met your ugly children,

221
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,362
I knew you had done me a real favor.

222
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,542
I am so deeply happy that
I'll never have to see your face again.

223
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,405
Love, Chuck.

224
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,277
Could you please, uh,
put in a fresh tape, dear?

225
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,054
I read about
that jaw reconstruction you did

226
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,026
using a microvascular
free transfer from the foot.

227
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,893
- You interested in plastics?
- Absolutely.

228
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,200
Might want to consider a transfer
to New York or Los Angeles.

229
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,034
You're not going to see any heat
up here.

230
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,971
Actually...

231
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,603
you ever seen an advanced case
of craniodiaphyseal dysplasia?

232
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,941
Lionitis?

233
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,613
Restrained driver in a minor MVC.

234
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,744
Vitals are stable
but witnesses saw seizure activity.

235
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,154
- I don't even think I need to be here.
- Let us determine that.

236
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,421
Witnesses said she was screaming
and clamping her jaw.

237
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,826
- Do you have a seizure disorder?
- Epilepsy?

238
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,864
It's not epilepsy. I don't have any...

239
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,992
Oh, no.
Oh God, it's happening again.

240
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,399
Oh, no.

241
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,350
Was that a...?

242
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,327
Did she just have a...?

243
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,419
Orgasm.

244
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,759
Spontaneous orgasms?

245
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,998
- Are you sure?
- Kind of hard to miss.

246
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,503
Ms. Calva,
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

247
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,342
It's Pamela.

248
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,872
Since we're talking about, you know,
may as well get familiar.

249
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,387
Pamela, can you tell me how long
this has been happening to you?

250
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,322
- For a few months, I guess.
- How often?

251
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,121
About... I don't know,
seven or eight times a day.

252
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,856
- Every day?
- Uh, Dr. Stevens.

253
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,524
I'm sorry. Every day?

254
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,590
Yes, every day.

255
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,501
And you haven't seen a doctor
about this before?

256
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,438
- It's not something you want to cure.
- Dr. O'Malley!

257
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,372
Sorry. Is it?

258
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,104
I went to my doctor.
He sent me to a shrink.

259
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,808
- And he didn't do any tests?
- Pammy? You back here?

260
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,852
- Oh, God, no! You called my father?
- Pammy?

261
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,047
He's your emergency contact person.

262
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,113
Pammy, what happened?

263
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,892
- You were in an accident?
- I caused the accident, Dad.

264
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,590
- You had one of your...?
- Episodes? Yeah.

265
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,429
Oh, no.

266
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,934
Dang it!

267
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,036
She's... a junior at U-Dub.

268
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,111
She's a math major.

269
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,580
Last three semesters
she made the honor roll.

270
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,277
High up in the honor roll.

271
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,578
Mr. Calva, we're going to...

272
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,847
run some tests and we're going to...

273
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,587
figure out what's causing
your daughter's...

274
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,822
- Episodes.
- That's right, episodes. OK.

275
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:09,357
And when you were 14, you stole
Laura Brendese right out from under me.

276
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,231
You knew how I felt about her,
don't say you didn't, because you knew.

277
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,606
And you went for her anyway.

278
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,167
What kind of human being
does that to his brother?

279
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,772
He was 14.
Cut him some slack for God's sakes!

280
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,113
Oh, sorry.
Forgot we were recording.

281
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:32,590
If you wouldn't mind
just rewinding a little bit, please.

282
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:39,293
I'm a doctor, not a videographer,
and I do need to prep you for surgery.

283
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,461
- But you offered to help.
- I thought you were saying goodbye.

284
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,366
I am saying goodbye.

285
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,430
None of these people, not one of them,
knows how I really feel.

286
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,471
My whole life, I've kept it all inside.

287
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,839
I don't want to carry this
with me to my grave.

288
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,408
You seem like such a nice man.

289
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,954
Wouldn't you rather
they remember you that way?

290
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,013
No.

291
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,851
Please rewind the tape?

292
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,364
It can get a little cramped in there,

293
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,162
so you have to try not to move.

294
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,171
Yeah, uh, this is like
my 50th MRI experience.

295
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,072
- Right, sorry.
- That's OK.

296
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,303
You have really nice eyes.

297
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,408
I'm just saying
that you're mostly all...

298
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,849
all surly and hardcore
but your eyes aren't.

299
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,384
I'm really big on eyes.

300
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,913
They're the only part on my face
where tumors aren't growing.

301
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,788
- Yeah, you've got nice eyes.
- Yeah?

302
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,195
You get that that I'm jailbait, right?

303
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,330
- Meredith.
- Chief.

304
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:58,432
Chief. Can I ask you something,
not work-related?

305
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,239
OK.

306
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,440
Do you remember my father?

307
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,777
- Of course.
- Do you know why he left?

308
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,847
I believe your mother asked him to.

309
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,518
Right. But do you know why?

310
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,891
No. No, I'm sorry, I don't.

311
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,526
- Well, have a good day.
- Thanks. You, too.

312
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,732
Dr. Yang, book an OR, please.

313
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,545
How is that possible?

314
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,014
It's precision work.
It won't be easy, but...

315
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,483
Dr. Sloan,
can I help you with something?

316
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,452
He says he can fix my face.

317
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,081
He says he can make me look like normal.

318
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,631
- What did he say? Did you hear that?
- Did he call him a crack whore?

319
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,793
Oh, shut up. I'm trying to read lips.

320
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,996
Shepherd's gesturing.

321
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,437
- What you got?
- They're battling it out.

322
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,175
- Oh, it's getting good.
- Why? What you got?

323
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,772
Just a woman down in the ER...

324
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,442
having spontaneous orgasms.

325
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,856
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

326
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,154
- That is not the point!
- The kid wants his face fixed!

327
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,194
No, you want to get published!

328
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,129
Yeah, and I'm guessing
your Chief of Surgery does too.

329
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,860
The press loves
a before-and-after shot, Richard.

330
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,492
Call me Dr. Webber.

331
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,099
Derek, out of friendship to you,

332
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,201
I would very much love
to say no to this... jackass.

333
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,974
- But as Chief...
- Please don't say it.

334
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,450
Dr. Sloan, if you can get the parents
to sign a consent form...

335
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,920
Round two goes to the jackass.

336
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,289
- Which one? Which one?
- Twelve o'clock.

337
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,058
Oh! Oh, no.

338
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,332
Oh, it's happening.

339
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,301
- Doctors? There something you need?
- No.

340
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,710
Well, in that case, move on.

341
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,510
I don't get what McDreamy
or McSteamy sees in her.

342
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,021
- She's McHot.
- Mc Yeah she is.

343
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,026
You're not even
a little bit happy to see me?

344
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,835
Go home. Whatever it is
you came here to do, just drop it.

345
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,774
Hey, we all made mistakes, Addison.
All three of us.

346
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,540
Somehow I lost my best friend
and the woman I loved.

347
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,774
Please... don't say that.

348
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,544
He doesn't know how we felt.

349
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,343
He doesn't know
you stayed with me after he left?

350
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,687
How do you expect to work out a marriage
if you can't even be honest with him?

351
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,750
- Why are you here?
- For one reason.

352
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,819
To bring you home.

353
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,791
I miss you, Addison.

354
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,697
I'm in love with my husband, Mark.

355
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,864
But he's not in love with you.

356
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,707
He's in love with that intern.
And he's not even trying to hide it.

357
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,611
Why would you want
to stick around for that?

358
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,122
- I think you're making it up.
- He's not. I saw it four times.

359
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,094
- What?
- Woman with spontaneous orgasms.

360
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,097
- Uh-huh.
- Really?

361
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,429
You're jealous
because you didn't see it.

362
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,331
Totally am.

363
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,233
Spontaneous orgasms?

364
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,102
- You look nice today.
- Any chance they're contagious?

365
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,632
Spontaneous orgasms,
that would solve so many problems.

366
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,611
It would, it would.
I think you smell nice, too.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,138
It's like, you see someone throw up,
it makes you throw up, too.

368
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,775
Kind of like.

369
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,957
You know what? I'm not hungry.
Do you hear me? I'm not hungry!

370
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,118
- Neither is the beast!
- The beast?

371
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,425
Is that like some
sly reference to your penis?

372
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,795
Get your mind out of the gutter,
crack whore.

373
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:19,030
No, it's not Alex's penis. It's...
when you haven't had sex for a long time

374
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,504
and you forget how good it is
so you want it less?

375
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,935
- That doesn't happen to me.
- Me, neither.

376
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,600
Me, neither.

377
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,281
I grew my hair for her and...

378
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,342
- I know.
- I don't think she's noticed.

379
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,220
You could just try
telling her how you feel.

380
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,785
Um... guys?
She's moving. Like, a lot.

381
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,357
Pamela, you have to hold still.

382
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,660
OK.

383
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,076
- That's not helping the beast sleep.
- No. No, it's not.

384
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,810
You're drawing the medial to the tumor?

385
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,181
Yeah.

386
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,483
It's a guideline for the bone structure.

387
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,422
You hear that?
I'm going to have bone structure.

388
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,191
Jake...

389
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:19,220
What do you think?
Am I a Dalí or more of a Picasso?

390
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,165
Could you stop doing that
for a minute?

391
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,295
Jake...

392
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,299
Jake, I'm sorry.

393
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,843
This surgery, the brain surgery,
is very dangerous.

394
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,441
No, don't say that.
Y- You don't get to change your mind.

395
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,351
I know Dr. Sloan
has made you some big promises,

396
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,423
but the bony tumors
inside your skull are bad.

397
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,053
- I don't care!
- The bleeding is hard to control.

398
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,721
I just want you to understand.

399
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,790
I do understand. This has nothing
to do with the plastic surgery.

400
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,802
If I'm going to be under the knife...

401
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,531
The plastic surgery can wait.

402
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,630
- You need to understand...
- Excuse me.

403
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,834
- Jake is actually right.
- Uh-huh.

404
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,640
No reason to put him through a second
round of surgery and anesthesia.

405
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,908
It's much safer
just to do it all at once.

406
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,951
Honey, we just want to focus
on keeping you alive.

407
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,010
Mom, I almost died
when I was ten years old.

408
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,989
And then again when I was 12,
and then again last year.

409
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,557
But...

410
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,462
But I'm still alive, I'm still alive.
So I say we go for it.

411
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,329
Jake...

412
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,925
I know you think I'm perfect
just the way I am,

413
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,166
but... that's your job to do that.

414
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,228
But...

415
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,035
for once in my life, I'd...

416
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,908
like to think that...

417
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,606
someone else thought that.

418
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,541
Please.

419
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,847
Please.

420
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,961
You've given up surgery
to go into clerical work?

421
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,099
I'm fulfilling a patient's dying wish
to send hate mail

422
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,972
to everyone he's ever met.

423
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,033
Ah.

424
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,144
- Right now I understand the impulse.
- Me, too.

425
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:20,879
- Why do people cheat?
- That's a good question.

426
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,781
Why do you think she cheated on you?

427
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,984
Were you different then?

428
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,357
Were you a bad husband?

429
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,126
I was, uh...

430
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:43,236
I was just a little... absent.

431
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,737
Not that that's an excuse for her.

432
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:52,042
Do you think things would
have been different if you'd had kids?

433
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,519
Do I think she wouldn't have cheated?

434
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,719
I don't know.

435
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,819
All right, Jake's ready to roll.

436
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,024
- Sorry, did I interrupt something?
- No.

437
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,331
Pamela, you should try and relax.

438
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,335
I am trying to relax.

439
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,039
The episodes happen when I don't relax.

440
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,648
Do you really think you can fix this?

441
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,519
I... hate to be insensitive,

442
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,618
but would it be the worst thing ever
if we can't? I mean...

443
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,994
You know, I like sex
as much as the next girl.

444
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,228
Like in bed or even in private.

445
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,798
But when you can't go to the movies
or drive a car,

446
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,603
or go to church with your parents...

447
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,143
Oh, my God.

448
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,040
You know that dream
where you show up in high school naked?

449
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,913
Yeah.

450
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:04,217
Yeah, well, I would really,
really like to wake up.

451
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,560
It's crossed the intrathoracic fascia?

452
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,569
I'm afraid so. I'm going
to have to go into the chest wall.

453
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,039
- He made 17 hate tapes.
- I'm sorry?

454
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,671
Videotapes of himself,
telling people how much he hated them,

455
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,443
spewing every hurt feeling he ever had.

456
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,042
- And he mailed them?
- No, he wanted me to,

457
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,021
but I don't think it's a good idea.
He was scared.

458
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,025
He was in shock.
He wasn't thinking clearly.

459
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,654
That's not for you to decide, Dr. Grey.

460
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,894
He asked you for something.
And you told him you would do it.

461
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:53,028
If you don't, that doesn't
make you noble, it makes you a liar.

462
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,865
Did you know she kept her apartment?

463
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,847
Yeah. I did. Sorry.

464
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:16,824
And now Dr. Shepherd
is opening the skull cap.

465
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,160
That's what he's doing.
Yes, he is.

466
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,996
Basin. This is done.

467
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,466
Oh, son of a bitch.

468
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,670
Give me a sponge.
Hang another unit of blood.

469
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,906
- I've got it.
- Too much blood.

470
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,744
- Pressure infuser.
- No carotid.

471
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,444
- We've got v-fib.
- Get ready to bag him.

472
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,215
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- Paddles!

473
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,722
- Quickly!
- Charge to 200.

474
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,780
Charging.

475
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,723
- Watch out, stand back.
- Clear!

476
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,004
Shame he never had his face fixed.

477
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,689
- Dr. Sloan?
- Yeah?

478
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,463
All right. I got the parent's approval.

479
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:38,069
- You don't... really need those.
- Right.

480
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,741
Scalpel.

481
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,158
Mr. Eaton? Can you hear me?

482
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,497
- Oh, God. Uh...
- Don't try to sit up.

483
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,627
You're going to be in pain
for some time.

484
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,571
But I'm pleased to report
we removed the entire tumor.

485
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,437
Wait, I'm alive?

486
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,773
Yes, sir.

487
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,005
You are alive.

488
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,748
My tapes.

489
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,153
Would you like me to throw them away?

490
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,532
No. I'd like you to mail them.

491
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,135
I have to say my piece.

492
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,343
Sometimes a man has to say his piece.

493
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,079
Mer.

494
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,682
Uh, do you want, uh...

495
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,627
I want to take you
out for a drink tonight.

496
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,063
Maybe not Joe's.
Maybe some place where we can talk?

497
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,896
There's something I need... want...

498
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,836
to talk to you about.

499
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,134
It's important. It's...

500
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,243
I don't want to make videotapes
on my deathbed.

501
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,283
She had an affair.

502
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,522
Yes.

503
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,299
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?

504
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,141
I did. I... I tried.

505
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,201
Why didn't you try harder?

506
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,478
You just left.

507
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,908
Meredith...

508
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,521
Is there anything that you need?

509
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,391
Anything at all?

510
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,464
No.

511
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,100
I don't need anything from you.

512
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

513
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,203
- I didn't see you all day.
- I didn't want to see you today.

514
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,040
- It's not my fault he showed up, Derek.
- I know.

515
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,319
- Don't beat yourself up.
- I'll take the stairs.

516
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,656
Oh, come on!

517
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,755
- How come you forgive her but not me?
- I didn't forgive her.

518
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,993
And with you,
I have no obligation to try.

519
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,401
Your marriage is over, Addison.

520
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,501
All you have to do is admit it.

521
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,643
Then you can come back home with me.

522
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,812
I'm going to the bar across the street.

523
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,019
Meet me there.

524
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,460
He looks... peaceful.

525
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,499
He does.

526
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,512
Um...

527
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,155
I am Preston Burke,

528
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,824
a widely renowned
cardiothoracic surgeon.

529
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,598
I am... a professional.

530
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,903
And more than that,
I'm a good and kind person.

531
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,465
I am a person
that cleans up behind myself.

532
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,943
I am a person that cooks well.

533
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,879
And you? You are an unbelievable slob.

534
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,712
A slovenly, angry intern.

535
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,650
I am Preston Burke

536
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,315
and you are the most competitive,
most guarded, most stubborn,

537
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,622
most challenging person
I have ever met...

538
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,685
and I love you.

539
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,361
What the hell is the matter with you
that you won't just let me?

540
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,098
I gave up my apartment
20 minutes ago.

541
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,146
Well, all right, then.

542
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,544
<i> I've heard</i>
<i>that it's possible to grow up.</i>

543
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,813
<i>I've just never met anyone</i>
<i>who's actually done it.</i>

544
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:12,258
Dr. Stevens? Um, after the surgery,
will I still be able to...

545
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,561
When I want to,
will I still be able to have...

546
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,625
you know, episodes?

547
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,905
Even better, Pamela,
you'll be able to have orgasms.

548
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:34,184
<i>Without parents to defy, we break</i>
<i>the rules we make for ourselves.</i>

549
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,050
<i>We throw tantrums</i>
<i>when things don't go our way.</i>

550
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:46,891
Hey.

551
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,956
She doesn't hear me.

552
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,134
- What?
- She doesn't even hear me when I talk.

553
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,736
She will if you make her.

554
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,038
You fed the beast, didn't you?

555
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:08,780
Twice.

556
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,888
I'll see you later.

557
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,952
Bye.

558
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,871
<i>We whisper secrets</i>
<i>with our best friends in the dark.</i>

559
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,942
Meredith came to see me today.

560
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,279
Poor baby. Poor thing.

561
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,314
Her father left, you know.

562
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,021
I think she knows about us, Ellis.

563
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,115
I think she's figured it out.

564
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,526
She's five years old, Richard.

565
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:55,027
<i>We look for comfort</i>
<i>where we can find it.</i>

566
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,362
This seat taken?

567
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,039
I guess not.

568
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,169
Double scotch, single malt.

569
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,942
You look sad.

570
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,384
I just saw my father
for the first time in 20 years.

571
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,363
How did that go?

572
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,423
Could have gone better.

573
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,969
What are you still doing here?

574
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,568
I'm hoping Addison shows up.

575
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:49,084
- You're still in love with her?
- You're still in love with him.

576
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,623
She won't show, you know.

577
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,682
No?

578
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,758
He's not the kind of guy you leave
if you can help it.

579
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,061
What if you're wrong?

580
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,230
What if, just this once...

581
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,171
life comes down on the side
of the dirty mistresses?

582
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,510
<i>And we hope,</i>

583
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,541
<i>against all logic,</i>
<i>against all experience.</i>

584
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,794
<i>Like children...</i>

585
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,302
<i>we never give up hope.</i>

586
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:46,666
Come in.

587
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,753
I know I'm not a world-renowned surgeon.

588
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:12,136
And I know I'm not a lot of things
that you've gone for in the past.

589
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,194
I know.

590
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,739
But...

591
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,668
I would never leave you.

592
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,174
I would never hurt you.

593
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,581
And I will never stop loving you.
