[derek_shepherd] finishes getting ready in [meredith_grey]'s bedroom while [meredith_grey] watches.
In the kitchen, [isobel_stevens] complains to [george_omalley] about [isobel_stevens]'s cupcakes not tasting right.
[george_omalley] disagrees and thinks [martha_stewart] would approve of the cupcakes.
[isobel_stevens] feels she's missing a specific ingredient.
[george_omalley] suggests calling [isobel_stevens]'s mother, but [isobel_stevens] refuses.
[meredith_grey] sees [derek_shepherd] brushing his teeth and suggests they sleep at [derek_shepherd]'s place.
[meredith_grey] questions why they always stay at hers and wonders if [derek_shepherd] has a place.
[derek_shepherd] doesn't respond and goes to the kitchen.
[derek_shepherd] greets [george_omalley], who offers [derek_shepherd] a cupcake.
[derek_shepherd] mentions he likes being there and that [meredith_grey] prefers her own things and bed as [derek_shepherd] prepares cereal.
[george_omalley] wonders if [derek_shepherd] is a health enthusiast because [derek_shepherd] eats muesli every morning.
[derek_shepherd] disagrees, but [isobel_stevens] insists [derek_shepherd] has been for the past week.
[derek_shepherd] then realizes he has been there all week.
[cristina_yang] is in a doctor's office.
[cristina_yang] tells someone she is starting an ENT rotation on the 9th and needs a procedure done before then.
However, there are no openings until the 16th.
The person suggests alternatives to termination, but [cristina_yang] interrupts and asks to be scheduled for the 16th.
[cristina_yang] plans to confirm after adjusting her schedule.

[devo_friedman] tells [alex_karev] she calls herself [devo_friedman].
[alex_karev] notices [devo_friedman] is wearing a long denim skirt under her gown and teases her about being Amish.
[devo_friedman] asks if [alex_karev] has ever seen an Orthodox Jew.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] is reviewing scans and comments that the patient should be in psych, questioning why the patient is being sent to surgery.
The psych resident explains the patient had a seizure two days ago and another one that morning.
[meredith_grey] reads the patient's chart and is confused.
The patient claims he can talk to dead people.
The patient's family thinks he's dangerous and had him committed, saying it's a psych case, not neuro.
[cristina_yang] questions if the psych resident went to med school, which offends the psych resident.
The psych resident replies that unlike [cristina_yang]'s 'correspondence school,' the psych resident learned not to jump to conclusions.
The psych resident sarcastically apologizes, saying psych can't take the patient back until [mr_duff] is cleared.
The psych resident explains [mr_duff] thinks his seizures are visions.
[mr_duff] overhears and insists he's psychic, not having seizures.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] enter the room and greet [mr_duff], telling [mr_duff] they will start a workup.
[mr_duff] thinks it's a waste of time.
[meredith_grey] checks [mr_duff]'s eyes while [cristina_yang] tests [mr_duff]'s grip.
[mr_duff] has another seizure and then tells [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] someone will die.
[cristina_yang] is unimpressed and thinks [mr_duff] is crazy.
[mr_duff] insists he's dizzy, not deaf, and says someone on the 4th floor will die.
A code blue is then called for the 4th floor.
[cristina_yang] feels nauseous as [cristina_yang] approaches the nurse's station to join [george_omalley].
[george_omalley] is preoccupied with thoughts about a psychic's prediction related to a dead person on the 4th floor.
[cristina_yang] ignores this and asks if [george_omalley] can cover for [cristina_yang] on the 16th.
[george_omalley], distracted by [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] approaching, mentions [george_omalley] might let his hair grow and consider a stubble look, asking [cristina_yang]'s opinion.
[cristina_yang] repeats her request for the 16th.
[george_omalley] agrees and asks why, but [cristina_yang] says it's not [george_omalley]'s concern and leaves.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] walk down the corridor.
[meredith_grey] expresses that [meredith_grey] feels she doesn't know much about [derek_shepherd].
[derek_shepherd] insists [meredith_grey] knows [derek_shepherd], mentioning [derek_shepherd] is from New York and likes ferry boats.
[meredith_grey] questions [derek_shepherd] about friends.
[derek_shepherd] replies that as a surgeon, [derek_shepherd] doesn't have friends.
[meredith_grey] continues to ask about [derek_shepherd]'s social life and activities on [derek_shepherd]'s days off, emphasizing their importance.
[derek_shepherd] wonders who it's important to.
[meredith_grey] mentions they have sex every night and thinks [meredith_grey] deserves details.
[derek_shepherd] believes [meredith_grey] knows more than most.
[meredith_grey] finds it strange and decides to withhold sex until [meredith_grey] knows [derek_shepherd] better.
[derek_shepherd] suggests [meredith_grey] should be flexible.
[meredith_grey] insists [meredith_grey] isn't, but [derek_shepherd] disagrees with a sly smile as [derek_shepherd] is called away.
[meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] stare at each other briefly.
[derek_shepherd] says discovering things is the fun part of a relationship, like the gravy, as [derek_shepherd] leaves.
[meredith_grey] shouts [meredith_grey] doesn't want to be [derek_shepherd]'s gravy.
[preston_burke] and [alex_karev] discuss [devo_friedman]'s treatment with [devo_friedman]'s parents in the lobby.
[devo_friedman] needs a valve replacement because [devo_friedman]'s labs show Von Willebrand's disease.
[preston_burke] and [alex_karev] explain [devo_friedman] can't take blood thinners needed for a mechanical heart valve and suggest a porcine valve instead.
[devo_friedman]'s father understands it's a pig valve.
[preston_burke] confirms it's the standard care for [devo_friedman]'s situation.
[devo_friedman]'s mother insists she just wants them to save [devo_friedman]'s life.
[miranda_bailey] and [isobel_stevens] are performing surgery to remove a lump.

[miranda_bailey] and [isobel_stevens] don't believe the psychic is real.
[isobel_stevens] mentions that the ICU is on the 4th floor, where people often die.
[miranda_bailey] is nearly done with the procedure and explains the next steps.
[isobel_stevens] insists the psychic is a fraud and claims she can predict the future better.

[mr_walker] feels nothing until [derek_shepherd] reaches [mr_walker]'s thigh.

[mr_walker] mentions he could move them about 10 minutes earlier while [derek_shepherd] checks the X-Rays.
[derek_shepherd] mentions the spine looks clear and asks about the injury details.
The injury happened while rock climbing in Snohomish.
It was a small fall, and [mr_walker] was belayed.

[derek_shepherd] checks [mr_walker]'s leg strength, and [mr_walker] asks if he should be worried.

[cristina_yang] speaks with the patient, [zoey_glass], who wants to delay chemotherapy until after her pregnancy.
[cristina_yang] explains this isn't possible because pregnancy hormones speed up the cancer.
[cristina_yang] states that none of the treatments will allow the baby to survive.
The doctors tell [zoey_glass] she must choose between undergoing treatment, which means an abortion, or refusing it and facing death later.
[derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] speak with [mr_walker] and his wife.
[meredith_grey] asks if [mr_walker] has been stressed lately and discusses with [derek_shepherd] how mental trauma can affect the body.
[mr_duff] arrives and tells [mr_walker] he believes him and it's not just in his mind.
[derek_shepherd] reassures [mr_walker] that he’s not crazy.
[devo_friedman] argues with her parents because she refuses a pig valve due to its non-kosher status.

[mr_walker] tells [derek_shepherd] he can't move his hands.

[alex_karev] goes to Devo’s room, where [devo_friedman]'s parents are present.
[alex_karev] informs [devo_friedman]'s parents about an alternative transplant option.

[preston_burke] arrives and hears the discussion.
[alex_karev] tells [preston_burke] that the bovine valve is better than the pig one, challenging [preston_burke] in front of [devo_friedman]'s family.
In the hospital corridor, [preston_burke] removes [alex_karev] from his duties for not consulting him first.
