[derek_shepherd] goes back to [meredith_grey]'s bedroom to finish getting ready. [meredith_grey] watches [derek_shepherd]. In the kitchen, [izzie_stevens] is with [george_omalley]. [izzie_stevens] is upset that her cupcakes don't taste right. [george_omalley] disagrees and thinks [martha_stewart] would be proud of [izzie_stevens]'s cupcakes. [izzie_stevens] believes [izzie_stevens] is missing one specific ingredient. [george_omalley] suggests [izzie_stevens] call [izzie_stevens]'s mother for help, but [izzie_stevens] refuses. [meredith_grey] watches [derek_shepherd] brush his teeth in the bathroom. [meredith_grey] suggests they sleep at [derek_shepherd]'s place tonight. [meredith_grey] wonders why they always sleep at [meredith_grey]'s place and questions if [derek_shepherd] even has one. [derek_shepherd] does not respond and goes downstairs to the kitchen. In the kitchen, [derek_shepherd] greets [george_omalley], who offers [derek_shepherd] one of [izzie_stevens]'s cupcakes for breakfast. [derek_shepherd] says he likes it at [meredith_grey]'s. [derek_shepherd] explains that [meredith_grey] prefers having her things there and sleeping in her own bed. Meanwhile, [derek_shepherd] gathers a bowl and cereal. [george_omalley] questions if [derek_shepherd] is a health nut because [derek_shepherd] eats muesli every morning. [derek_shepherd] disagrees with this idea. [izzie_stevens] insists that [george_omalley] has been a health nut for at least the last week.
[derek_shepherd] then realizes [derek_shepherd] has been at [meredith_grey]'s place all week. [cristina_yang] is in a doctor's office. When someone enters, [cristina_yang] mentions [cristina_yang] is starting an ENT rotation on the 9th. [cristina_yang] needs to complete [cristina_yang]'s current task before that, but there are no openings until the 16th. The person informs [cristina_yang] about other options besides termination and tries to discuss them. [cristina_yang] interrupts and asks to be scheduled for the 16th. [cristina_yang] says [cristina_yang] will confirm after adjusting [cristina_yang]'s schedule. The person attempts to talk about options again, but [cristina_yang] cuts the person off, stating [cristina_yang] is not interested in discussing it. [alex_karev] is examining [devo_friedman], a patient who had a root canal that has been bleeding. [preston_burke] enters and asks for the bullet. [alex_karev] explains that [devo_friedman] is a 17-year-old girl in the hospital for heavy bleeding after a root canal. [devo_friedman] also has a new heart murmur and a fever, but [devo_friedman] is not feverish while on antibiotics. [devo_friedman] asks if [devo_friedman] is going to die and wants to call [devo_friedman]'s parents in the cafeteria. [preston_burke] reassures [devo_friedman] that [devo_friedman] is not dying. [preston_burke] tells [devo_friedman] that [alex_karev] will run some tests and [preston_burke] will return with [devo_friedman]'s parents later. After [preston_burke] leaves, [alex_karev] wonders about [devo_friedman]'s name. [devo_friedman] mentions an 80s rock band and jokes that [devo_friedman]'s parents used drugs. [devo_friedman] tells [alex_karev] [devo_friedman] prefers to be called [esther].
When [alex_karev] pulls back [devo_friedman]'s blanket, [alex_karev] sees [devo_friedman] is wearing a long denim skirt under [devo_friedman]'s hospital gown.
[alex_karev] playfully asks [devo_friedman] if [devo_friedman] is Amish.
[devo_friedman] responds by asking [alex_karev] if [alex_karev] has ever seen an Orthodox Jew.
Meanwhile, [cristina_yang] is looking at scans.
[cristina_yang] believes the patient should be in psychiatry and questions why the hospital is sending the patient to surgery.
The psychiatric resident explains that the patient had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning.
[meredith_grey] reads the patient's chart and is confused by the patient's claims.
The patient insists he can communicate with dead people.
The patient's family believes the patient is dangerous and had the patient committed, stating it is a psychiatric issue, not a neurological one.
[cristina_yang] questions the resident's medical education, which offends the resident.
The resident responds that the resident learned not to make quick judgments, unlike [cristina_yang].
The resident sarcastically apologizes and mentions that the psychiatric department won't take the patient back until the patient is cleared.
The resident explains that the patient thinks the patient's seizures are actually visions.
The patient argues that the patient is psychic, not having seizures.
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] enter the room and greet [mr_duff].
[meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] inform [mr_duff] that they will begin a workup, but [mr_duff] thinks it is pointless.
While [meredith_grey] examines [mr_duff]'s eyes, [cristina_yang] tests [mr_duff]'s grip.
During this, [mr_duff] has another seizure.
After the seizure stops, [mr_duff] warns [meredith_grey] and [cristina_yang] that someone will check out soon. [cristina_yang] remains skeptical and believes [mr_duff] is unstable. [mr_duff] claims he feels dizzy and insists that someone on the 4th floor is going to die. At that moment, a code blue is announced for the 4th floor. [cristina_yang] feels nauseous as she approaches the nurse's station. [cristina_yang] joins [george_omalley], who is preoccupied with thoughts about a psychic's prediction regarding a deceased man on the 4th floor. [cristina_yang] asks [george_omalley] if he can cover for her on the 16th. [george_omalley] is distracted by [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] walking toward them. [george_omalley] mentions he is considering growing his hair out and not shaving for a stubbly look. [cristina_yang] reminds [george_omalley] that she needs him to cover the 16th. [george_omalley] agrees but asks why [cristina_yang] needs him. [cristina_yang] tells [george_omalley] it is not his concern and walks away. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] walk down the corridor. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] discuss how [meredith_grey] feels she doesn't know much about [derek_shepherd]. [derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] she knows basic things, like he is from New York and likes ferry boats. [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] about his friends. [derek_shepherd] replies that as a surgeon, he doesn't have friends. [meredith_grey] presses [derek_shepherd] about who he spends time with and what he does on his days off, calling these important questions.
[mr_duff] wonders who the information is important to. [meredith_grey] mentions that she and [derek_shepherd] have sex every night and feels she deserves more details. [derek_shepherd] replies that [meredith_grey] knows more than most people. [meredith_grey] finds this strange and decides to withhold sex until she knows [derek_shepherd] better. [derek_shepherd] suggests that [meredith_grey] should be more flexible. [meredith_grey] insists she isn't flexible, but [derek_shepherd] smiles slyly and is called away. [meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] share a moment of eye contact. [derek_shepherd] says they will learn about each other, calling it the fun part of a relationship, like gravy, as he leaves. [meredith_grey] shouts that she doesn't want to be [derek_shepherd]'s gravy. [preston_burke] and [alex_karev] are in the lobby discussing [devo_friedman] and [esther]'s treatment with [esther]'s parents. [esther] needs a valve replacement due to Von Willebrand's disease. [preston_burke] and [alex_karev] explain that [esther] cannot take blood thinners needed for a mechanical heart valve. They recommend a porcine valve instead. [esther]'s father realizes that this means a pig valve. [preston_burke] explains that it is the standard care for someone like [esther]. [esther]'s mother insists she just wants them to save [esther]'s life. [miranda_bailey] and [izzie_stevens] are in surgery to remove a lump. Mrs. Glass is awake and asks about the psychic in the hospital.
[miranda_bailey] and [izzie_stevens] do not believe the psychic is real.
[izzie_stevens] mentions that the ICU is on the fourth floor and that people die there often.
[miranda_bailey] is almost done with the procedure and explains what will happen next.
[izzie_stevens] remains focused on the psychic, claiming he is a fake and that [izzie_stevens] can see further into the future than the psychic can.
[miranda_bailey] wonders why [izzie_stevens] is so bothered by the psychic, but [izzie_stevens] denies it.
Meanwhile, [derek_shepherd] is testing nerve response on [mr_walker]'s leg.
[mr_walker] cannot feel anything until [derek_shepherd] reaches [mr_walker]'s thigh.
[derek_shepherd] asks [mr_walker] to try wiggling [mr_walker]'s toes, but [mr_walker] cannot.
[mr_walker] mentions that [mr_walker] was able to wiggle them about ten minutes earlier while [derek_shepherd] reviews the X-rays.
[derek_shepherd] notes that the spine appears clear and asks how the injury happened.
[mr_walker] explains that [mr_walker] was rock climbing in Snohomish.
[mr_walker] states it was a small drop, and [mr_walker] had a belay.
[mr_walker] mentions that [mr_walker]'s family is on the way.
[derek_shepherd] tests [mr_walker]'s leg strength.
[mr_walker] asks if [mr_walker] should be worried.
[derek_shepherd] tells [mr_walker] to relax and calls for a nurse to arrange an MRI.
[derek_shepherd] also asks [meredith_grey] to accompany [mr_walker].
Meanwhile, [george_omalley] is trying to intubate a patient.
[alex_karev] tries to assist [george_omalley] but makes [george_omalley] more anxious. [george_omalley] makes a mistake and puts the ventilator into the esophagus. [dr_preston_burke] arrives and successfully inserts the ventilator on his first attempt. [cristina_yang] is in Mr. Duff’s room, where [mr_duff] flirts with [cristina_yang]. [cristina_yang] reviews the test results and informs [mr_duff] that he has epilepsy. [cristina_yang] requests an MRI. Meanwhile, [mr_duff] realizes that [cristina_yang] is pregnant, almost as if he had a vision. [cristina_yang] asks [miranda_bailey] to stop having [mr_duff] as her patient. [miranda_bailey] agrees but wants [cristina_yang] to handle [cristina_yang]'s post-operative paperwork for the next month. [miranda_bailey] then assigns [cristina_yang] a case involving a pregnant patient with breast cancer. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] examine the X-rays of a paralyzed patient. [meredith_grey] starts asking [derek_shepherd] personal questions because [meredith_grey] feels she doesn't know much about [derek_shepherd]. [cristina_yang] speaks with the patient, [zoey_glass], who wants to postpone chemotherapy until after [zoey_glass]'s pregnancy. [cristina_yang] explains that this is not possible because pregnancy hormones can worsen the cancer. [cristina_yang] tells [zoey_glass] that none of the treatments will allow the baby to survive. The doctors ask [zoey_glass] to choose between undergoing treatment, which would result in an abortion, or refusing treatment and facing death later. [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] speak with [mr_walker] and [mr_walker]'s wife. [meredith_grey] asks if [mr_walker] has been stressed lately.
[cristina_yang] then tells [derek_shepherd] that mental trauma can show up in physical ways.
[mr_duff] arrives and tells [mr_walker] that [mr_duff] believes [mr_walker].
[mr_duff] insists that it is not just a psychosomatic issue.
[derek_shepherd] reassures [mr_walker] that [mr_walker] is not crazy.
[devo_friedman] argues with [devo_friedman]'s parents about not wanting a pig valve because pigs are non-kosher.
[dr_preston_burke] warns [devo_friedman] that [devo_friedman] could die without the surgery.
[devo_friedman] asks [alex_karev] to help [devo_friedman] find another option.
[izzie_stevens] performs an MRI on [mr_duff] while [mr_duff] flirts with [izzie_stevens].
The residents chat about hospital food.
[cristina_yang] points out [harper] and encourages [george_omalley] to approach her.
[george_omalley] tells [izzie_stevens] to call [izzie_stevens]'s mother for her birthday.
[cristina_yang] is with [zoey_glass], who shares that [zoey_glass] got pregnant at an older age after trying for a long time.
[zoey_glass] now faces a tough decision.
[cristina_yang] interrupts and reassures [zoey_glass] that [zoey_glass] has a good chance of surviving.
[cristina_yang] warns that if [zoey_glass] stops treatment, [zoey_glass] won't see [zoey_glass]'s child grow up.
[mr_walker] informs [derek_shepherd] that [mr_walker] cannot move [mr_walker]'s hands.
[derek_shepherd] quickly prepares an operating room, suspecting a clot in the spine.
[meredith_grey] worries that [derek_shepherd] might be mistaken and that the surgery could be unnecessary.
[derek_shepherd] decides to trust his instincts.
[alex_karev] performs an ultrasound on [devo_friedman] and notices [devo_friedman]'s condition is getting worse.
[alex_karev] and [devo_friedman]'s relationship grows closer, and they discuss faith.
[izzie_stevens] finds [miranda_bailey] to show [miranda_bailey] [mr_duff]'s brain CT scan.
[miranda_bailey] and [izzie_stevens] see an arteriovenous malformation in the left lobe.
[izzie_stevens] wants to prepare the operating room.
[miranda_bailey] stops [izzie_stevens] and says [izzie_stevens] needs authorization from the surgeon first.
[miranda_bailey] thinks [izzie_stevens] is too emotionally involved with the patients.
[izzie_stevens] disagrees.
[derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] are operating on [mr_walker].
[meredith_grey] is unsure about the surgery and questions the ethics of doing it without full knowledge.
[miranda_bailey] and [cristina_yang] enter [zoey_glass] Glass’s room.
[zoey_glass] has decided to have an abortion.
As [miranda_bailey] and [cristina_yang] leave, [miranda_bailey] asks [cristina_yang] if [cristina_yang] has ever done a dilation and curettage.
[cristina_yang] will have to perform the procedure.
[alex_karev] and [george_omalley] are in the office.
[george_omalley] asks [alex_karev] how [alex_karev] attracts so many women.
[alex_karev] makes a joke about it.
[alex_karev] learns that a bovine valve can be transplanted into patients.
[alex_karev] tells [george_omalley] that [alex_karev] thinks too much and does not act enough.
[alex_karev] goes into Devo’s room, where Devo’s parents are present.
[alex_karev] tells Devo’s parents that he found an alternative transplant option.
[alex_karev] explains that [dr_preston_burke] can use a bovine valve instead of a pig valve.
[dr_preston_burke] arrives and hears the discussion.
[alex_karev] tells [dr_preston_burke] that the bovine valve is better than the pig valve, challenging [dr_preston_burke] in front of Devo’s family.
In the hospital corridor, [dr_preston_burke] takes [alex_karev] off his duties for not consulting [dr_preston_burke] first.
[izzie_stevens] goes into Mr. Duff’s room.
[izzie_stevens] asks [mr_duff] to sign papers for Mr. Duff’s surgery.
[izzie_stevens] explains that [mr_duff] needs the surgery to stop the malformation from rupturing.
[izzie_stevens] mentions that Mr. Duff’s visions are due to this condition.
[mr_duff] calls [izzie_stevens] "Cricket," which surprises [izzie_stevens].
[cristina_yang] enters [zoey_glass] Glass’s room to prepare [zoey_glass] for the curettage.
[zoey_glass] and [zoey_glass] Glass’s husband have decided not to abort.
[cristina_yang] tries to persuade [zoey_glass] otherwise.
[zoey_glass] asks if [cristina_yang] can guarantee [zoey_glass] Glass’s survival after the treatment.
[cristina_yang] admits she cannot guarantee it.
[zoey_glass] shares that [zoey_glass]'s mother died of cancer, so [zoey_glass] wants to keep the baby. [cristina_yang] suggests getting a psychiatric intervention, but [zoey_glass] declines. Later, [cristina_yang] is alone and deep in thought in the dormitory. [preston_burke], who has been avoiding [cristina_yang], joins [cristina_yang]. [preston_burke] tells [cristina_yang] that [preston_burke] doesn’t know how to perform the bovine transplant. [cristina_yang] tells [preston_burke] that [preston_burke]'s problem can be solved. [meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] are in the operating room with [mr_walker]. [meredith_grey] and [derek_shepherd] need to find a clot quickly because there is damage to [mr_walker]'s sympathetic nervous system. [george_omalley] walks down the corridor when [harper] asks for [george_omalley]'s help to intubate a patient. [preston_burke] sees [george_omalley] performing the procedure and watches [george_omalley] closely. The procedure goes well, and [harper] praises [george_omalley]. [preston_burke] meets [alex_karev] on the stairs and asks [alex_karev] how long it will take to get a bovine valve. [alex_karev] is pleased that [preston_burke] trusted [alex_karev]'s instincts. [preston_burke] also asks [alex_karev] to find a rabbi for a blessing for [devo_friedman]. Meanwhile, [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] locate the clot in [mr_walker]'s back. After the surgery, [derek_shepherd] and [meredith_grey] talk. [derek_shepherd] tells [meredith_grey] he sees their relationship as real. [meredith_grey] asks [derek_shepherd] to prove it.
[cristina_yang] brings discharge documents to [zoey_glass].
[zoey_glass] tells [cristina_yang] that [cristina_yang] misjudged her.
